tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Nothing, nothing; only leave me to myself," he answered but the tears were running down his cheeks.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby," said Tabitha, shedding tears.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There were tears in the eyes of the old maid, as she spoke of the beloved of her youth, and of their betrothal in the wood.	H,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"When God is so hard to me, how can I expect men to be better?" she said with groans and tears.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And Molly and Anthony both wept, but these tears all flowed together into one tear which had the rosy shimmer of joy.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the way was unfit for the girls; they would have torn their dresses.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The hens, chicks, and even the cock sought shelter; the wind tore down the planks between the two yards with a crash; the tiles came tumbling down, but the weather-cock sat firm.	F,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She sung of the quiet churchyard, where the white roses grow, where the elder-tree wafts its perfume on the breeze, and the fresh, sweet grass is moistened by the mourners' tears.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had no tears to shed, and he felt no pain; no thought of Molly came into his mind.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the wind kissed the tree, and the dew watered it with tears; but the fir-tree regarded them not.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The daughter was taken into the forest where she was torn to pieces by wild beasts, but the witch was cast into the fire and miserably burnt.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And at length they fell into rags and tatters, and thought it was all over with them, for they were torn to shreds, and steeped in water, and made into a pulp, and dried, and they knew not what besides, till all at once they found themselves beautiful white paper.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Where now were the tears he had shed?	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	How much came back to his remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native town!	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut off his head and feet.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He and his sister, two years older than himself, had often wept scalding tears over the story of Him who suffered death on the cross for us all.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	During the whole week she was sad and wept many bitter tears, but when Sunday came again she said: "Now I have suffered and striven enough.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And all this about the two children was mirrored to old Anthony in a single tear, which could soon be wiped away and disappear, but might come again from its source in the heart of the old man.	Sa,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the tears come into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed me."	H,H
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But as yet I did not understand that the sorrows of my own countrymen were mirrored in those tears.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he left her by herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.	F,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Hallo! how the nightcap burns!" he exclaimed, as he tore it from his bead.	Su-,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	. . . and it sees the bad Rabbit tearing past--without any tail or whiskers!	Su+,F
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I kissed her hand, and wept bitter tears, and I wept still more when I went to my room, and threw myself on the bed.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I shall never forget that I drew tears from your eyes the first time I sang to you.	H,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Tiny looked after him, and the tears rose in her eyes.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I will break down the apple-tree, and tear it up by the roots; never more shall it blossom or bear fruit."	A,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Why, when grandmother's tears fall upon the rose, and she is looking at it, the rose revives, and fills the room with its fragrance; the walls vanish as in a mist, and all around her is the glorious green wood, where in summer the sunlight streams through thick foliage; and grandmother, why she is young again, a charming maiden, fresh as a rose, with round, rosy cheeks, fair, bright ringlets, and a figure pretty and graceful; but the eyes, those mild, saintly eyes, are the same,- they have been left to grandmother.	H,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down her cheeks!	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the king replied: "She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will not have her named."	N,A
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Then we shall not meet," said the king's son, nodding to the poor boy, who went into the deepest part of the wood, where the thorns tore his shabby clothes and scratched his hands, face, and feet until they bled.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	On the following Sunday they all went to church, and she was asked whether she wished to go too; but, with tears in her eyes, she looked sadly at her crutches.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The wind will blow through the frock, and the thorns will tear it off my body."	Su-,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I have seen tears in an emperor's eyes," she said, "that is my richest reward.	H,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	How vividly were represented to him, in a glittering tear that rolled down his cheek, two children at play- a boy and a girl.	N,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the king"s own heart, and he soon died.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Aunt Pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket handkerchief, then she wiped Pigling Bland's nose and shed tears; then she wiped Alexander's nose and shed tears; then she passed the handkerchief to Spot.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Here she sat down with her hymn-book, and as she was reading it with a pious mind, the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the church, and in tears she lifted up her face and said: "O God! help me!"	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven, with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague, the ugly heavy stone.	H,H
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After some time, the linen was taken into the house, placed under the scissors, and cut and torn into pieces, and then pricked with needles.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	My mother could make fishermen's nets, for which there was a great demand here in the bay; and we lived a long time by the side of the sea, the beautiful sea, that had a taste like tears, and in its colors reminded me of the stag that wept red tears; for sometimes its waters were red, and sometimes green or blue.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I have bought this flower at a high price, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has you, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you."	N,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah!" said the wife, "and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that my teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins," and she tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the corner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.	F,F
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She has a hymn-book with large silver clasps, in which she often reads; and in the book, between the leaves, lies a rose, quite flat and dry; it is not so pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass, and yet she smiles at it most pleasantly, and tears even come into her eyes.	H,H
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he tore away the cloth which covered the basket, and what could equal the surprise of the pious woman, to find that by a miracle, everything in her basket- the wine, the bread- had all been changed into roses.	N,Su+
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mad with pain, he tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them far away, and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat.	A,A
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before.	H,H
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"'O Glove, my own dear, Though it cost thee a tear, Thou must be mine, For Holger Danske has sworn it!'	H,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A hot tear rolled into her lap, and formed itself into a pearl, glowing with all the colors of the rainbow.	Sa,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel: "Now all is over with us."	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She had not a button- that she knew right well, and therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside, till all the others had seen the grave and had gone away; then she sat down, held her little brown hands before her eyes, and burst into tears; this girl alone had not seen Puggie's grave.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But this was scarcely an agreeable entertainment; for thoughts of olden memories raise the curtains from the past, and sometimes pierce the heart with painful recollections till the agony brings tears to the waking eyes.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He did not himself know why he wept, yet a kind of pleasant feeling mingled with his tears.	H,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She tore off her stockings, but the shoes had grown fast to her feet.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Far in the interior of the wood, where a noisy swarm of laborers were working, stood Waldemar Daa and his three daughters, and all were laughing at the wild cries of the birds, excepting one, the youngest, Anna Dorothea, who felt grieved to the heart; and when they made preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead, and on whose naked branches the black stork had built her nest, she saw the poor little things stretching out their necks, and she begged for mercy for them, with the tears in her eyes.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And tears gushed from his eyes like a stream of mercy and love, the cooling waters of which extinguished the eternal fire of hell.	F,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Oh, my poor child," and she burst into tears.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bitter tears fell upon the jasmine twig, and each day, as she became paler and paler, the sprig appeared to grow greener and fresher.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at last her tears softened him, and he said, "I will give you three days" grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your child."	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She was buried; two large tears rolled over the cheeks of the earnest man, and in the parsonage it was empty and still, for its sun had set for ever.	Sa,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	From the street could be seen the room in which the walls were covered with leather, ragged and torn, and the green in the balcony hung straggling over the beams; they pulled it down quickly, for it looked ready to fall, and at last it was cleared away altogether.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that the blood ran down.	F,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back.	H,H
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into pieces and sprinkled salt upon it."	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth.	N,Su+
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve o"clock the young man met the princes going to the bath and gave her the kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears that he would let her take leave of her father.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Bush and herb shot upward, and some even tore themselves up by the roots to rise more quickly.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Tears stood in his eyes, and glistened on his cheeks; he carried a great book and the binding was of velvet, with silver clasps.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So words and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married to the fiddler.	Sa,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"No, wife," said the man, "I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces."	Sa,F
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Tears of sorrow rolled down their cheeks, and fell in heavy drops on the floor, but not a word was spoken.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Said he: "I am your dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms; but I am alive still, and will soon set you free."	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Nobody shed a tear over him; his face was covered over with a white cloth, under his head they had placed a large thick book, the leaves of which consisted of folded sheets of blotting-paper, and withered flowers lay between them; it was the herbarium which he had gathered in various places and was to be buried with him, according to his own wish.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But Marleen stood looking on, and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no need of salt.	Sa,Sa
quiet answers to questions	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The young man answered considerately, as if the question had been a different one, "No; he does not come from a great family."	N,N
quiet answers to questions	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As the grandmother had plucked out the three golden hairs, and the three questions were answered, she let the old serpent alone, and he slept until daybreak.	N,N
quiet answers to questions	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I never ask a question twice," said the beetle, after he had asked this one three times, and received no answer.	N,N
quiet answers to questions	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Only be quiet," answered the old woman, and comforted her by saying, "when the time comes I shall be ready."	A,N
quiet answers to questions	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And so, on every summer day the dance was repeated, the same questions asked, and the same answers given.	N,N
quiet answers to questions	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But don't ask me any questions, for I shan't answer you."	N,N
quiet answers to questions	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the garter was naturally shy, and did not know how to answer such a question.	N,F
quiet answers to questions	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he called one of his lords-in-waiting, who was so high-bred, that when any in an inferior rank to himself spoke to him, or asked him a question, he would answer, "Pooh," which means nothing.	D,N
quiet answers to questions	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Those are difficult questions," answered she, "but only be silent and quiet and pay attention to what the devil says when I pull out the three golden hairs."	N,N
feeling heavy or numb	[('DENIAL', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	"And I," said the mother, "I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm were coming."	F,F
feeling heavy or numb	[('DENIAL', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	"Feel," said he, "how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight weeks old.	N,H
taking up a task or chore to pass the time	[('EAGERNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	A long time passed, and the shirt collar was taken in a bag to the paper-mill.	N,N
taking up a task or chore to pass the time	[('EAGERNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon you for ever."	N,N
taking up a task or chore to pass the time	[('EAGERNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	But he said: "You have dipped your finger into the water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let anything go in."	A,N
being the first to speak	[('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At first Ib said not a word, but he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then he spoke,- "Christina must not refuse this good fortune."	Sa,Sa
being the first to speak	[('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in the dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good deal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his house was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company: however, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet had laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and they bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.	F,H
looking down unable to meet someone’s eyes	[('EMBARRASSMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They recalled to the memory the well-known look in the eyes of a child, or in the eyes of lovers who had once met beneath the branches of the old oak.	N,N
looking down unable to meet someone’s eyes	[('EMBARRASSMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said "good morning" to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up.	N,F
discomfort in close spaces	[('ANXIETY', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space from closing up.	N,N
pointing a finger while confronting	[('SUSPICION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The fingers then placed the point of the needle against the cook's slipper.	N,N
pointing a finger while confronting	[('SUSPICION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Sweet-tooth, his neighbor, dipped himself into sweet or sour, pointed to the sun and moon, and formed the letters when the fingers wrote.	N,N
pointing a finger while confronting	[('SUSPICION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Just look at little Miss Glove, how she's pointing her fingers!	N,N
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The conversation on this topic was only interrupted for a moment by the arrival of a newspaper, which did not, however, contain much worth reading, and while it is still going on we will pay a visit to the ante-room, in which cloaks, sticks, and goloshes were carefully placed.	N,N
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property--and other people's--and depart at once.	F,N
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She ran down, set a jug, said: "God bless it for you, Gretel," and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.	H,H
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Lucie knocked-once-twice, and interrupted the song.	N,N
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mew!" interrupted Simpkin, and he scratched at the door.	N,N
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mind--" "Wee, wee, wee!" interrupted Alexander again.	N,N
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises--	Su-,Su-
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	We have always had the reputation of being pious, so we will allow them to pick up the corn with us; they don't interrupt our talk, and they scrape so prettily when they bow."	N,N
hot eyes and cheeks	[('HUMILIATION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	The boy had rosy cheeks, golden ringlets, and clear, blue eyes; he was the son of Anthony, a rich merchant; it was himself.	N,N
hot eyes and cheeks	[('HUMILIATION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	It is seen on the blooming cheeks of my sweet child, when it expresses the pure and holy love of infancy; when refreshed by sleep it opens its eyes, and smiles upon me with childlike affection."	H,N
hot eyes and cheeks	[('HUMILIATION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.	H,H
hot eyes and cheeks	[('HUMILIATION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	What red cheeks and what angels' eyes! but they have no shoes nor stockings.	Sa,N
hot eyes and cheeks	[('HUMILIATION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	At the window of one of them sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks, and clear sparkling eyes, who was very fond of the old house, in sunshine or in moonlight.	N,H
hot eyes and cheeks	[('HUMILIATION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	He read, "Greater love hath no man than this," and as he read a roseate hue spread over the cheeks of the queen, and her eyes became so enlightened and clear, that she saw from the leaves of the book a lovely rose spring forth, a type of Him who shed His blood on the cross.	H,N
hot eyes and cheeks	[('HUMILIATION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.	N,N
hot eyes and cheeks	[('HUMILIATION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	Her powers of body were almost exhausted, but her eyes flashed brightly, and on her cheeks was a rosy flush.	N,N
hot eyes and cheeks	[('HUMILIATION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	Why, when grandmother's tears fall upon the rose, and she is looking at it, the rose revives, and fills the room with its fragrance; the walls vanish as in a mist, and all around her is the glorious green wood, where in summer the sunlight streams through thick foliage; and grandmother, why she is young again, a charming maiden, fresh as a rose, with round, rosy cheeks, fair, bright ringlets, and a figure pretty and graceful; but the eyes, those mild, saintly eyes, are the same,- they have been left to grandmother.	H,N
hot eyes and cheeks	[('HUMILIATION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	Tears stood in his eyes, and glistened on his cheeks; he carried a great book and the binding was of velvet, with silver clasps.	Sa,Sa
putting on a smile	[('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"Will not one knock soon?" asked the boy; and the mother smiled while she put elder-tree blossoms into the teapot and poured boiling water over them.	N,H
clasping one’s hands together	[('WORRY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('NERVOUSNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy.	Su-,H
clasping one’s hands together	[('WORRY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('NERVOUSNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, "When you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry "Jip!""	N,N
criticism	[('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But from that time forward, the whole shop, from the cash box down to the pinewood logs, formed their opinions from that of the cask; and they all had such confidence in him, and treated him with so much respect, that when the huckster read the criticisms on theatricals and art of an evening, they fancied it must all come from the cask.	N,N
swearing	[('IRRITATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I have sworn it: my will must be done!"	A,N
swearing	[('IRRITATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, "I have sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word."	F,Sa
swearing	[('IRRITATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.	A,A
swearing	[('IRRITATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They had sworn brotherhood in their youth, and the most beautiful and virtuous maiden in the neighborhood was chosen to perform the act of consecration upon this bond of friendship.

throat clearing swallowing	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the other he swallowed them down his throat.	N,Sa
throat clearing swallowing	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now Partlet found a very large nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it stuck in her throat.	N,N
throat clearing swallowing	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The kernel, however, was so large that she could not swallow it, and it remained sticking in her throat, so that she was alarmed lest she should be choked.	F,F
shaking all over	[('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Shake me, shake me, I pray; my apples, one and all, are ripe," it cried.	F,N
shaking all over	[('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now I shake the pen!	N,N
shaking all over	[('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She only shook her head at him.	N,N

going for a walk	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Therefore they let him go alone; and as he walked on, the solitude of the wood produced a feeling of reverence in his breast; but still he heard the little bell about which the others rejoiced, and sometimes, when the wind blew in that direction, he could hear the sounds from the confectioner's stall, where the others were singing at tea.

complaining	[('ANNOYANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bird complained to the dog of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

holding one’s head in one’s hands	[('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.	N,Su+
holding one’s head in one’s hands	[('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There they lay with their anger, holding their heads on one side and blinking the eye that was turned upwards.	A,A

N,N
standing with one arm holding the other at the elbow	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His eyes were as clear and his face was as radiant as sunshine; and he held his mother in his arms, and she kissed his mouth, and wept as blissfully as any one can weep for joy; and he nodded at every old piece of furniture in the room, at the cupboard with the tea-cups, and at the flower-vase.	H,H
standing with one arm holding the other at the elbow	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now he had carved Holger Danske, who stood there erect and proud, with his long beard, holding in one hand his broad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the Danish arms.	N,N
standing with one arm holding the other at the elbow	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"He says that you must go and open that large chest which stands in the corner, and you will see the evil one crouching down inside; but you must hold the lid firmly, that he may not slip out."	N,N
standing with one arm holding the other at the elbow	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They placed him on the table, and- how many curious things do happen in the world!- there he was in the very same room from the window of which he had fallen, there were the same children, the same playthings, standing on the table, and the pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door; she still balanced herself on one leg, and held up the other, so she was as firm as himself.	N,N
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the second girl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to the one who was on the King"s right hand, "Hilloa! hilloa!	N,N
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	First they peeped into the basket containing the eels and the sucking-pig; then they must needs pull out the pig and take it in their hands, and feel it, and touch it; and as they both wanted to hold it at the same time, the consequence was that they let it fall into the water, and the pig sailed away with the stream.	Su-,N
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first.	N,N
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.	N,Su+
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The presents of gold and precious stones which had been received with it were round the bird, and it was now advanced to the title of "Little Imperial Toilet Singer," and to the rank of No. 1 on the left hand; for the emperor considered the left side, on which the heart lies, as the most noble, and the heart of an emperor is in the same place as that of other people.	N,N
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In a large party it is very disagreeable to find a button giving way, with no studs at hand to fall back upon; but it is worse still in a large company to be conscious that your wife and mother-in-law are talking nonsense, and that you cannot depend upon yourself to produce a little ready wit to carry off the stupidity of the whole affair.	N,N
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The young married pair often sat together hand in hand; he would talk, but she could only now and then let fall a word in the same melodious voice, the same bell-like tones.	N,N
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It is a miserable story indeed, especially now I have fallen into the hands of boys.	N,Sa
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So they made a boat out of a newspaper, and placed the tin soldier in it, and sent him sailing down the gutter, while the two boys ran by the side of it, and clapped their hands.	H,H
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the window-sill stood a myrtle in a pot, and this had been pushed a little on one side, that it might not fall out; for the old maid was leaning out of the window, that she might see.	N,N
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then a man took it up to remove it, and one of the bees stung him in the hand, so that he let the flower-pot fall, and it was broken to pieces.	N,N
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His staff had fallen out of his hand, and his eyes stared at the moon, about which his honest soul was wandering.	N,N
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then you will come to a great high castle, on the threshold of which you must let the wand fall, and go straight through the castle, and out again on the other side.	N,N
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care.	H,H
hands falling to the sides	[('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands.	F,F
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But they did not know what endless misery he had brought upon other countries, nor did they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from the debris of the destroyed cities.	N,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The father sighed, and answered him: "You shall soon learn what it is to shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that."	A,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The daughter sighed very gently; and how much there may be in a sigh, or attributed to it!	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah," he sighed, "if I were only on the other side of the Alps now, it would be summer, and I should be able to get money on my letter of credit.	Sa,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah! wretch that I am!" sighed she; "why did I not marry King Grisly-beard?"	A,A
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The young man attributed a great deal of meaning to this sigh.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And in a few moments deep sighs were heard, as of children weeping.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah," sighed the woman heavily, "if I had but a child, as red as blood and as white as snow," and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted.	H,H
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	We complied, and she wrote; but in the midst of the "General War-" she struck fast, sighed deeply, and said, "I am only a woman!"	Su-,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Alas!" sighed she, "if any of my father"s court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!"	Sa,F
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I heard him sighing like a soul in despair; I heard him praying, and I noticed how he held his breath.	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Good gracious!" he sighed, "I must have a tendency to softening of the brain, and here it is so exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head."	Su-,Su-
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Yes, this is my fate," and he sighed deeply.	N,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But at each "pop," which was a deep sigh, the tree was thinking of a summer day in the forest; and of Christmas evening, and of "Humpty Dumpty," the only story it had ever heard or knew how to relate, till at last it was consumed.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ah! how often then it thought of those better days- of the times when in the fresh, green wood, it had poured forth rich wine; or, while rocked by the swelling waves, it had carried in its bosom a secret, a letter, a last parting sigh.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The lieutenant felt this very keenly, and therefore leaned his head against the window-frame, and sighed deeply.	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!" sighed she; "would that I had married King Grisly-beard!"	A,A
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Beautiful Italy!" sighed some of the guests.	N,H
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Tweet, tweet," sighed he, "what a dreadful snowstorm!" and then he became silent.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, "splash, splash," he went into the water without touching him, "Oh," sighed the duckling, "how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me."	H,H
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Yus, yus!" sighed Aunt Pettitoes.	D,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last he sighed, "but the student has no jam!"	A,Su-
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Oh dear, oh dear," sighed Little Claus in the sack, as he turned and twisted about; but he found he could not loosen the string with which it was tied.	F,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He bent his head mournfully, and sighed in deep sorrow, as an unquiet spirit might sigh.	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	No; their sighs and lamentations still sounded from above; and she had nearly forgotten them, for the sake of him who was dead.	N,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It makes me unhappy to think that I shall die, and leave this poor child," sighed she.	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed.	A,A
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah!" he sighed mournfully, as he gazed at the birds singing merrily, or hopping from branch to branch, "they are much better off than I. Flying is a glorious power.	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little mice also kept away after this, and the tree sighed, and said, "It was very pleasant when the merry little mice sat round me and listened while I talked.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A low sigh was heard.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I know very well where she is," sighed the top; "she is in the swallow's nest, and has married the swallow."	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he sighed and said, "Ah, if I were but that Bavarian peasant, who likewise had three wishes granted to him, and knew quite well what to do, and in the first place wished for a great deal of beer, and in the second for as much beer as he was able to drink, and in the third for a barrel of beer into the bargain."	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	What a dreadful place; I shall never see them again!" sighed Benjamin.	Sa,F
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Benjamin sighed with relief.	H,H
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"'O-h, o-h,' she sighed; for people can sigh like the moaning of the wind among the reeds and rushes.	Sa,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At two o"clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses; but even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, "I know he has fallen asleep."	Sa,A
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I am certainly all wrong," said he, with a sigh; and yet I only drank one glass of punch.	Su-,A
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Aunt Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows--	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Alas! how soon all that is good and beautiful passes away," sighed the elf.	Sa,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ah, yes," he sighed, "I know one, in which everything is solid, but a servant is there already, and that is the only thing against it.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The maiden sighed and said, "My step-mother practises wicked arts; she is ill-disposed toward strangers."	Sa,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The pieces were placed in a fire under the copper, and they quickly blazed up brightly, while the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a pistol-shot.	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ugh!" sighed the daisy, "that is terrible; now they are done for."	Su-,Su-
words are chosen deliberately	[('SOMBERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They wanted to go out and woo the King's daughter; for the maiden in question had publicly announced that she would choose for her husband that youth who could arrange his words best.	N,N
closing off all thoughts of what is happening	[('HUMILIATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, "If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me."	H,H
closing off all thoughts of what is happening	[('HUMILIATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree-- there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.	F,N
closing off all thoughts of what is happening	[('HUMILIATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The Grasshopper seated himself out in the ditch, and thought and considered how things happened in the world.	N,N
closing off all thoughts of what is happening	[('HUMILIATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Many thoughts came into her mind; but the thought never came, that quite close to her, in that very window, was a remembrance of those olden times,- the neck of the bottle which had, as it were shouted for joy when the cork flew out with a bang on the betrothal day.	N,N
a raised eyebrow and a see look	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They only came to see our mountain, to ascend Parnassus amid the snow and clouds, and to look at the strange black rocks which raised their steep sides near our hut.	N,N
asking a few token questions	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	But don't ask me any questions, for I shan't answer you."	N,N
asking a few token questions	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"If you must ask questions, ask sensible ones," said their mother.	D,N
asking a few token questions	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	I am travelling on a secret embassy, but you must not ask me any questions, for I cannot betray my secret."	N,N
asking a few token questions	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on the spot if he would be pope.	Su+,N
asking a few token questions	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Pig- wig's gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland.	N,H
asking a few token questions	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	She certainly might have asked more sensible questions; but if she had not been allowed to say just what she liked, would her daughter have been there, leaning so gracefully on her shoulder, and looking straight before her, with a smile that was almost mournful on her face?	N,N
asking a few token questions	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	He asked several questions about the wood and about the exact position of the house and shed.	N,N
asking a few token questions	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"Are you ill? where do you live? have you been here all day?" were some of the questions asked by the old man.	N,N
asking a few token questions	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"I never ask a question twice," said the beetle, after he had asked this one three times, and received no answer.	N,N
asking a few token questions	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Lovers pluck off the leaves, and as they pluck each leaf, they ask a question about their lovers; thus: "Does he or she love me?- Ardently?	N,N
asking a few token questions	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And so, on every summer day the dance was repeated, the same questions asked, and the same answers given.	N,N
asking a few token questions	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Then he called one of his lords-in-waiting, who was so high-bred, that when any in an inferior rank to himself spoke to him, or asked him a question, he would answer, "Pooh," which means nothing.	D,N
eyes that appear cold dead flat	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the youngest child in the room, a boy, with large, earnest eyes, mounted upon a chair behind the window curtains, and looked out into the yard, where the moon was pouring a flood of light on the old gravestone,- the stone that had always appeared to him so dull and flat, but which lay there now like a great leaf out of a book of history.	N,N
an inability to find words	[('AMAZEMENT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"Upon my word!" cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat.	Su+,Su+
an inability to find words	[('AMAZEMENT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The king came in the morning, and, finding all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller"s daughter, and she really became queen.	N,H
an inability to find words	[('AMAZEMENT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The inscription "Institution for Superior Education" was found near the billiard club, which place of resort was further adorned with the words, "Children brought up by hand."	N,N
an inability to find words	[('AMAZEMENT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	She was of few words, and of a dark countenance; but she did not know how to climb, so I blew her overboard before any one found out that she was a woman; and, in my opinion, that was well done," said the Wind.	N,N
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his coming back.	F,F
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four brothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other, set off towards their father"s home, where they told him all that had happened to them, and how each had learned some craft.	H,N
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	There they all landed, and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty.	N,N
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And as the sun rose and set, the bottle felt as at the time of its first existence, when in the heated glowing stove it had a longing to fly away.	N,N
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	After they had traveled about for a long time, they came to a town in which was a beautiful but proud princess, who had caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever should set her a riddle which she could not guess, that man should be her husband; but if she guessed it, his head must be cut off.	N,N
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into partnership and set up house together.	N,N
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said, "Prince, whither so fast?"	F,Su-
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And he gave a large sum of money to the swindlers, in advance, that they should set to work without any loss of time.	N,N
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When the time came, the father and son went out together to the place agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself and his father in the middle of it.	N,N
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	THERE lived once upon a time a wicked prince whose heart and mind were set upon conquering all the countries of the world, and on frightening the people; he devastated their countries with fire and sword, and his soldiers trod down the crops in the fields and destroyed the peasants' huts by fire, so that the flames licked the green leaves off the branches, and the fruit hung dried up on the singed black trees.	Su-,N
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make haste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set her free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with her.	N,N
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened to him.	N,N
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	For, when the mouse had made the fire and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest until it was time to set the table.	N,N
setting a time limit	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Ferry me across first," said the luck-child, "and then I will tell you how you can be set free," and when he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil"s advice: "Next time any one comes, who wants to be ferried over, just put the oar in his hand."	N,N
sitting quietly	[('SOMBERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I sit here patiently and quietly.	N,N
sitting quietly	[('SOMBERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But after what he had seen, the goblin could no longer sit and listen quietly to the wisdom and understanding down stairs; so, as soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret, he took courage, for it seemed to him as if the rays of light were strong cables, drawing him up, and obliging him to go and peep through the keyhole; and, while there, a feeling of vastness came over him such as we experience by the ever-moving sea, when the storm breaks forth; and it brought tears into his eyes.	H,N
sitting quietly	[('SOMBERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was forced to sit down in a corner behind the door, and was to stay quietly and peaceably there, in order that the Lord, when he returned, might not observe him and be angry.	N,N
sitting quietly	[('SOMBERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He glanced, with a very critical eye, at all the flower-beds, and found that the flowers were seated quietly and demurely on their stalks, just as maidens should sit before they are engaged; but there was a great number of them, and it appeared as if his search would become very wearisome.	D,Sa
sitting quietly	[('SOMBERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a confidential conversation together.	H,N
becoming unaware of one’s environment or other people	[('ADORATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"'Yes,' said the old woman, 'I remember it very well; we used to water the branches, and one of them, an elder-tree branch, took root, and grew and became the large tree under which we are now sitting as old people.'	N,N
singing humming chanting	[('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	May beetles hummed, the bees murmured, the birds sang, each in his own way; the air was filled with the sounds of song and gladness."	H,H
a flat tone of voice	[('SUSPICION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The young married pair often sat together hand in hand; he would talk, but she could only now and then let fall a word in the same melodious voice, the same bell-like tones.	N,N
making small jittery movements with the fingers	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger.	N,N
tipping or turning the head to the side	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There they lay with their anger, holding their heads on one side and blinking the eye that was turned upwards.	A,A
eyes that glow with inner light	[('EXCITEMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	I blew up the fire in the coals on the hearth, and it threw a red glow on his ghastly white face, lighting it up with a glare, while his sunken eyes looked out wildly from their cavernous depths, and appeared to grow larger and more prominent, as if they would burst from their sockets.	N,N
warding someone or something off	[('DENIAL', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called: "Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you."	N,N
gathering opinions on what others would do	[('CONFLICTED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts.	N,N
gritting one’s teeth	[('ANGUISH', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"Red-head," said the soldiers, and little Peter laughed; but when one of them sometimes said to another, "Foxey," he would bite his teeth together and look another way- into the wide world.	N,N
a desire to go unnoticed	[('REGRET', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The boat was moored; and the two men, after desiring the children to sit still, both went on shore. they obeyed this order for a very short time, and then forgot it altogether.	N,N
a desire to go unnoticed	[('REGRET', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	That jewel was the continual striving and desire to go upward- ever upward.	N,N
a desire to go unnoticed	[('REGRET', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then the forbidden door alone remained, and she felt a great desire to know what could be hidden behind it, and said to the angels, "I will not quite open it, and I will not go inside it, but I will unlock it so that we can just see a little through the opening."	N,N
a desire to go unnoticed	[('REGRET', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling.	A,A
head resting on one’s hand	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one.	H,H
head resting on one’s hand	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"See," cried the youngest, "there is a new one;" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, "There is another swan come; a new one has arrived."	H,H
head resting on one’s hand	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	No one was in the street but himself; it belonged only to him, so he boldly seated himself on the pig's back, leaned forward so that his curly head could rest on the head of the animal, and, before he was aware, he fell asleep.	N,N
approaching people with ease	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Many people came out of the side rooms where the beautiful marble statues stood and approached the grave where lay the great master who had created these works of art.	N,N
turning the torso shielding it	[('DREAD', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The oldest of the policemen used to make a speech from the platform on which the shield was hung up, and the speech was in verse, as if it had been made by a poet, as, indeed it had; for three people had concocted it together, and they had first drunk a good bowl of punch, so that the speech might turn out well.	N,N
speaking in a flat voice	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Delightful indeed," cried a voice quite near to them; no one but the tin soldier saw that it came from a rag of the leather which hung in tatters; it had lost all its gilding, and looked like wet earth, but it had an opinion, and it spoke it thus:-	N,N
speaking in a flat voice	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off her stool, and overset the milk-pail.	F,F
speaking in a flat voice	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	This is what she thought of, and often spoke of in a low voice to herself.	N,N
speaking in a flat voice	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All at once at his elbow, a little voice spoke--"My name is Pig-wig.	N,N
speaking in a flat voice	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Heaven speaks to us in our native tongue, in the voice of the Bird of Popular Song.	N,N
holding the hands loosely behind the back	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Nothing nothing," he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it.	F,F
holding the hands loosely behind the back	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, "Throw the rascal up here!"	F,F
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"You need have no anxiety for the morrow; and when you are old there is a pension for you."	N,N
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The kids said: "Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go away without any anxiety."	N,N
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness.	H,H
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: "What is to become of us?	Sa,Sa
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then their anxieties are dispelled; and at even they join in the dance at the feast given in the great hall at Borglum.	H,N
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	He thought of all the terror and anxiety which he had undergone, and felt thankful from his heart for the reality and comfort of modern times, which, with all their errors, were far better than those in which he so lately found himself.	H,N
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The anxiety I feel on this matter prevents me from enjoying myself in Switzerland.	Sa,F
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then quite composedly, and as if he had not an anxiety in the world, he took some nuts out of his pocket, cracked them, and ate the kernels.	H,H
distancing oneself from others	[('WORRY', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The others were all obliged to retire to a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the man who had been with the miller"s wife.	Su+,N
distancing oneself from others	[('WORRY', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	They have been brought from a great distance, and consequently I treat them with greater respect than I do the others."	N,N
rubbing someone’s back	[('SYMPATHY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they went back to the meadow together, but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone.	F,N
rubbing someone’s back	[('SYMPATHY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called: "Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you."	N,N
moaning	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They ride the shortest way, through the waving reeds, where the wind moans sadly.	N,N
moaning	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he would give him great riches.	A,N
moaning	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The gnats were buzzing about and stinging, while the miserabili, outside, moaned in their dreams.	N,N
moaning	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I blew the smoke and ashes into his face and beard; I moaned through the broken window-panes, and the yawning clefts in the walls; I blew into the chests and drawers belonging to his daughters, wherein lay the clothes that had become faded and threadbare, from being worn over and over again.	N,N
moaning	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The wind moans very strangely here, both within and without.	N,N
shoulders pushing back	[('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime had come, the witch"s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall.	F,N
shoulders pushing back	[('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But Tom, hearing of the bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father"s coat to his shoulder and whispered in his ear, "Take the money, father, and let them have me; I"ll soon come back to you."	H,H
shoulders pushing back	[('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest.	N,N
shoulders pushing back	[('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The ass placed himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog"s shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat"s head.	N,N
shoulders pushing back	[('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he laid hold of Little Claus round the body, and pushed him into the sack, which he took on his shoulders, saying, "Now I'm going to drown you in the river.	A,N
shoulders pushing back	[('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away.	F,F
sipping a drink or taking a bite to eat	[('SADNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.	N,N
sipping a drink or taking a bite to eat	[('SADNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee.	H,H
sipping a drink or taking a bite to eat	[('SADNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it away and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he took it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and drink, her plate and cup were always empty.	N,N
sipping a drink or taking a bite to eat	[('SADNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Then she said: "Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God"s good gifts be spoilt?"	H,H
sipping a drink or taking a bite to eat	[('SADNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, "If you will not eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink counts for nothing," and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and drank.	N,A
explaining that one is not in denial	[('DENIAL', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And now the professor of botany presented himself, one who could explain his knowledge in black and white.	N,N
explaining that one is not in denial	[('DENIAL', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	It can be opened and explained, so that people may understand how the waltzes are formed, and why one note follows upon another."	N,N
making excuses	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('AGITATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Thereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-inlaw, and made all manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine.	F,N
making excuses	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('AGITATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The youth, full of joy, set out homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king"s beautiful daughter, who had now no more excuses left to make.	H,H
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Anne Lisbeth walked on, thinking of nothing at all, as people say, or rather her thoughts wandered, but not away from her, for thought is never absent from us, it only slumbers.	N,N
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they went away again, and the king said to the lion: "You have lied to me, they walk just like men."	Su-,A
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A sailor boy had flung his large cap over the bird, and a hand came underneath and caught the clerk by the back and wings so roughly, that he squeaked, and then cried out in his alarm, "You impudent rascal, I am a clerk in the police-office!" but it only sounded to the boy like "tweet, tweet;" so he tapped the bird on the beak, and walked away with him.	A,F
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then, as it was Sunday morning and the weather very fine, he said to himself, "A walk to Fredericksburg will do me good:" so away he went.	N,N
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the soldier now threw away all the silver money he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack with gold instead; and not only his pockets and his knapsack, but even his cap and boots, so that he could scarcely walk.	N,N
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest.	Sa,F
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He then walked away towards the Metal Pig, half knelt down, clasped it with his arms, and then put his mouth to the shining snout and drank deep draughts of the fresh water.	N,N
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As she turned to walk away, much came into her mind that she had heard in her childhood: old superstitions of spectres by the sea-shore; of the ghosts of drowned but unburied people, whose corpses had been washed up on the desolate beach.	N,F
an inability to stay still	[('AGITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They waited there for half a day, and the food still remained warm and smoking, and at length they were so hungry that they sat down and ate, and agreed with each other that they would stay and live in that castle, and that one of them, who should be chosen by casting lots, should remain in the house, and the two others seek the King"s daughters.	N,N
an inability to stay still	[('AGITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But when evening came and she still stayed away, Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the corn asleep.	Su+,N
an inability to stay still	[('AGITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Her terror too would not quit her, let her do what she might, and her heart beat continually and would not be still; the gold too stayed on her finger, and would not go away, let her rub it and wash it never so much.	F,F
an inability to stay still	[('AGITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All went right: then the fox said, "When you come to the castle where the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and when you get it into your hand, ride away."	N,N
repeating the word no	[('DEFEAT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"Down to my child," she repeated; and tones of despair and entreaty sounded in the words.	Sa,Sa
repeating the word no	[('DEFEAT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	But she repeated the words of the song, "I will drive them across the islands to the deep sea; but before evening came the roebuck was slain, and before the night the hunted stag was dead."	N,N
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But don't ask me any questions, for I shan't answer you."	N,N
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"If you must ask questions, ask sensible ones," said their mother.	D,N
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I am travelling on a secret embassy, but you must not ask me any questions, for I cannot betray my secret."	N,N
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pig- wig's gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland.	N,H
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She pointed at Pigling's plate; he hastily gave it to her, and fled to the meal chest--"How did you come here?" asked Pigling Bland.	N,N
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She certainly might have asked more sensible questions; but if she had not been allowed to say just what she liked, would her daughter have been there, leaning so gracefully on her shoulder, and looking straight before her, with a smile that was almost mournful on her face?	N,N
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He asked several questions about the wood and about the exact position of the house and shed.	N,N
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Are you ill? where do you live? have you been here all day?" were some of the questions asked by the old man.	N,N
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I never ask a question twice," said the beetle, after he had asked this one three times, and received no answer.	N,N
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Lovers pluck off the leaves, and as they pluck each leaf, they ask a question about their lovers; thus: "Does he or she love me?- Ardently?	N,N
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Both swindlers requested him to come near, and asked him if he did not admire the exquisite pattern and the beautiful colours, pointing to the empty looms.	N,N
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Why do the flowers look so faded to-day?" she asked again, and pointed to her nosegay, which was quite withered.	D,N
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And so, on every summer day the dance was repeated, the same questions asked, and the same answers given.	N,N
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mrs Fox asked: "Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed mouth?"	N,Su+
asking pointed questions	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he called one of his lords-in-waiting, who was so high-bred, that when any in an inferior rank to himself spoke to him, or asked him a question, he would answer, "Pooh," which means nothing.	D,N
eyes brightening as memories are recalled	[('NOSTALGIA', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They recalled to the memory the well-known look in the eyes of a child, or in the eyes of lovers who had once met beneath the branches of the old oak.	N,N
turning one’s back to the source	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When it came to her turn to sing, she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she could not refuse.	Sa,N
turning one’s back to the source	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the little ship sailed away; sometimes the current of the water seized it, but whenever it went too far from the shore one of the boys turned up his trousers, and went in after it, and brought it back to land.	N,N
turning one’s back to the source	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the master had turned his back, Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: "Standing so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows when they will come?	N,N
turning one’s back to the source	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he went down stairs again into the huckster's shop, and it was a good thing he got back when he did, for the cask had almost worn out the lady's tongue; he had given a description of all that he contained on one side, and was just about to turn himself over to the other side to describe what was there, when the goblin entered and restored the tongue to the lady.	N,N
turning one’s back to the source	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah!" replied the horse, "justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so."	Sa,Sa
hands curling around one’s middle	[('EMBARRASSMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.	H,N
hands curling around one’s middle	[('EMBARRASSMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower, and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he found his Jorinda again.	Su+,N
shaking the head in disapproval but not saying anything	[('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At first Ib said not a word, but he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then he spoke,- "Christina must not refuse this good fortune."	Sa,Sa
shaking the head in disapproval but not saying anything	[('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Already a new emperor had been chosen and the people who stood in the street asked the lord-in-waiting how the old emperor was; but he only said, "Pooh!" and shook his head.	D,N
shaking the head in disapproval but not saying anything	[('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said, "No, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, I might very soon go begging myself.	D,N
shaking the head in disapproval but not saying anything	[('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he shook his head and said, "It cannot possibly be the bishop himself."	Su-,N
shaking the head in disapproval but not saying anything	[('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on the head with them: but they only said, "It must be near morning, for the wind shakes the fir-apples down."	N,Su-
shaking the head in disapproval but not saying anything	[('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the old man who had spoken of all this shook his head mournfully, and said, "Forgotten!	N,Sa
shaking the head in disapproval but not saying anything	[('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Let me see him," said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, "It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy."	H,H
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he closed the lid, seated the dog upon it again, and walked into another chamber, And, sure enough, there sat the dog with eyes as big as mill-wheels.	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor, inhabited by wild ducks.	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Suddenly a feeling of fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep, that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him.	Su-,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She was laid in a black coffin, looking mild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen, though her eyes were closed; but every wrinkle had vanished, her hair looked white and silvery, and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile.	H,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It has been raised from only a little sprig of myrtle that you gave me on the day after my betrothal, and from which I was to make my own bridal bouquet when a year had passed: but that day never came; the eyes were closed which were to have been my light and joy through life.	Sa,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	How gentle and sweet he looks as he lies there with his eyes closed!	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Several of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing, and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in keeping his countenance, but the smile on his lips faded away; for he caught sight of a pair of dark-blue eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady.	N,H
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree-- there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.	F,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She sang successfully through three or four verses, only at every verse her head nodded a little lower, and her little twinkly eyes closed up--	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A pious, faithful soul closed her eyes for ever; she was the pastor's wife. ..."If any one shall find rest in the grave and mercy before our Lord you shall certainly do so," said the pastor.	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They disputed about it for a time, but as they were weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more.	A,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Close by her galloped four snorting steeds, with fire flashing from their eyes and nostrils.	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They closed their eyes and- and- Well, now the story is ended!	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And she drew the curtains close round the little bed, so that the sun might not shine in their eyes.	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Bring her the loveliest rose in the world; one which exhibits the purest and brightest love, and if it is brought to her before her eyes close, she will not die."	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then before the eyes of little Tuk appeared a confusion of colors, red and green; but it cleared off, and he could distinguish a cliff close to the bay, the slopes of which were quite overgrown with verdure, and on its summit stood a fine old church with pointed towers.	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At the nearest corner, a lamp hung before a picture of the Madonna; but the light it gave was almost useless, for he only perceived it when he came quite close and his eyes fell on the painted figures of the Mother and Child.	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A little spider, which he could however not see, busily and cheerfully spun its web above him, so that there should be a kind of little banner waving over the old man, when his eyes closed.	N,H
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But in front of the tan-yard, close to the entrance, stood a little girl clothed in rags, very pretty to look at, with curly hair, and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look into them.	H,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill," said one of the lizards; "I have not been able to close my eyes for two nights on account of the noise; I might just as well have had the toothache, for that always keeps me awake."	A,A
difficulty making friends	[('INSECURITY', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The soldier had now plenty of money; he returned to his elegant rooms, and reappeared in his fine clothes, so that his friends knew him again directly, and made as much of him as before.	N,N
difficulty making friends	[('INSECURITY', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"What makes you pant so, my friend?" said the ass.	N,Su-
mouth snapping shut	[('AMAZEMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Pig-wig opened her mouth and shut it again; Pigling coughed asthmatically.	N,N
blinking	[('SADNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('CURIOSITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked up, blinking, and saw an offensively ugly elderly man, grinning from ear to ear.	H,N
lips pressed flat	[('SUSPICION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He turned round and was going away, but she seized his hand and pressed it to her lips.	N,N
lips pressed flat	[('SUSPICION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It is quite a picture to see a half-naked boy clasping the well-formed creature by the head, as he presses his rosy lips against its jaws.	Su+,N
poor eating habits	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he came to his father"s house, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him, and said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would not even give him anything to eat.	N,Sa
poor eating habits	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And so the poor old horse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.	N,H
poor eating habits	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Poor little Tiny stood before the door just like a little beggar-girl, and begged for a small piece of barley-corn, for she had been without a morsel to eat for two days.	Sa,N
poor eating habits	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered, "Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers" den; your betrothed does indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards cook and eat you.""	N,N
poor eating habits	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he dressed himself as a poor man, and came secretly to the king"s court, and was scarcely within the doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and princess left off weeping.	N,H
screaming crying blubbering	[('TERROR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried: "You have invited a fine guest!"	A,A
screaming crying blubbering	[('TERROR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood; it was an ugly cry, and it frightened the children; but before them, in the thickest part of the forest, grew the most beautiful blackberries, in wonderful quantities.	F,F
screaming crying blubbering	[('TERROR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She was so terrified at this, that she ran crying and screaming to her mother.	F,F
screaming crying blubbering	[('TERROR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and when their parents again brought food they said: "We will not so much as touch one fly"s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been here and has insulted us!"	A,A
screaming crying blubbering	[('TERROR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The cries and screams of the savage horde and of the birds sounded through the air, and I joined in it also; for I sang 'Ding-dong! ding-dong!'	Sa,F
screaming crying blubbering	[('TERROR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the mannikin screamed terribly, and cried, "Stop, stop, and let me go, and I will tell thee where the King"s daughters are."	F,F

aches and pains	[('DEPRESSION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	But guessing was of very little use; it made his bark ache, and this pain is as bad for a slender fir-tree, as headache is for us.	N,N
touching one’s mouth or face	[('ADORATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His eyes were as clear and his face was as radiant as sunshine; and he held his mother in his arms, and she kissed his mouth, and wept as blissfully as any one can weep for joy; and he nodded at every old piece of furniture in the room, at the cupboard with the tea-cups, and at the flower-vase.

F,N
sitting then standing then sitting again	[('WORRY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, "Throw the rascal up here!"

crying or calling out in release	[('RELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought their lamps to look at her, and said, "Good heavens! what a lovely child she is!"	Su+,Su+
crying or calling out in release	[('RELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: "Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!"	F,F
stepping back	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round.

asking are you sure or what if questions	[('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She certainly might have asked more sensible questions; but if she had not been allowed to say just what she liked, would her daughter have been there, leaning so gracefully on her shoulder, and looking straight before her, with a smile that was almost mournful on her face?	N,N
asking are you sure or what if questions	[('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It must be done, for very shame; you are sure to be asked when you come back if you have seen everything, and will most likely be told that you've omitted to see what was best worth seeing of all.	D,D

tension in the neck and shoulders	[('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The elder children broke off the flowers with long stems, bent the stalks one round the other, to form links, and made first a chain for the neck, then one to go across the shoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a wreath to wear round the head, so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands of green stems and golden flowers.

closing eyes and squealing	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then before the eyes of little Tuk appeared a confusion of colors, red and green; but it cleared off, and he could distinguish a cliff close to the bay, the slopes of which were quite overgrown with verdure, and on its summit stood a fine old church with pointed towers.	N,N
closing eyes and squealing	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At the nearest corner, a lamp hung before a picture of the Madonna; but the light it gave was almost useless, for he only perceived it when he came quite close and his eyes fell on the painted figures of the Mother and Child.	N,N
closing eyes and squealing	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.	N,N
closing eyes and squealing	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A little spider, which he could however not see, busily and cheerfully spun its web above him, so that there should be a kind of little banner waving over the old man, when his eyes closed.	N,H

closing eyes and squealing	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill," said one of the lizards; "I have not been able to close my eyes for two nights on account of the noise; I might just as well have had the toothache, for that always keeps me awake."

head tilting away	[('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, "I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will soon have a daughter."

checking one’s breath	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She sat in splendid rooms, richly decorated with silk and velvet; not a breath of air was allowed to blow upon her, and no one was allowed to speak to her harshly, for she was nurse to the count's child.	N,N
checking one’s breath	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It is so cold outside that one"s very breath freezes!	Su-,N
rubbing or pulling at an ear	[('CONFLICTED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it for the king"s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.

hands that tremble	[('DREAD', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king"s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her.

silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His very silence now proves his affection."	N,N
silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they ceased, and all around became still; not a bird could be heard, they were all at rest, even the owl had not left her hiding place; deep silence reigned on the margin of the wood by the sea-shore.	N,N

placing a hand on the chest	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered that each brick, when finished, brought him in a small coin, if only a copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one upon another, can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a person knocks, who has a number of these in his hands, whether it be the baker's, the butcher's, or the tailor's, the door flies open, and he can get all he wants.

openness when dealing with people	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I have gone through a great deal in my time, when I come to recollect: I have been in the fire and in the water, I have been deep in the earth, and have mounted higher in the air than most other people, and now I am swinging here, outside a bird-cage, in the air and the sunshine.

drumming feet against the floor	[('AMUSEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands, and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open.

drumming feet against the floor	[('AMUSEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the middle of the floor lay a dead swallow, his beautiful wings pulled close to his sides, his feet and his head drawn up under his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of the cold.	Sa,N
drumming feet against the floor	[('AMUSEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Some witch told you that!-- some witch told you that!" cried the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it out.	A,A

mouth falling open	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea upon a few planks.	F,F

saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: "I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening.	H,Sa
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"A lucky hit!" said he, as he called to his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.	H,H
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the elfin girl said that the stories about the ring-finger and little Peter Playman had not yet been told.	N,N
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Mother says you can tell a fairy tale about anything you look at or touch."	N,N
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"If you would do me any good I would willingly tell you," said the merchant.	N,N
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"You will presently understand it," said the old man who told the story.	N,N
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then said she to the man"s daughter, "Listen, tell thy father that I would like to marry him, and then thou shalt wash thyself in milk every morning, and drink wine, but my own daughter shall wash herself in water and drink water."	N,N
crossing one’s arms	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	No, my dear husband, it must be that one," said the queen, pointing to a second door having a cross also.	N,N
crossing one’s arms	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	No one could tell where the dance begun, or where it ended, nor indeed which were legs and which were arms, for they were all flying about together, like the shavings in a saw-pit!	N,N
crossing one’s arms	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when she really had the little child in her arms, and held it up to its father, then it was like one of the angels in the church to behold, with hair like gold- the gleam of the setting sun was upon it.	N,N
crossing one’s arms	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She gathered herself up, and hastened to the churchyard; but black crosses and black ravens danced before her eyes, and she could not distinguish one from the other.	N,N
crossing one’s arms	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He thought it so beautiful that he got up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers.	H,Su+
crossing one’s arms	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now at the gate each suitor was provided with a number, and all were placed in rows immediately on their arrival, six in each row, and so closely packed together that they could not move their arms; and that was a prudent arrangement, for they would certainly have come to blows, had they been able, merely because one of them stood before the other.	N,N
crossing one’s arms	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The flame trembled on his breast and in his heart, and it was in the peasant's room that his heart became one for the Danish arms.	N,N
crossing one’s arms	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His eyes were as clear and his face was as radiant as sunshine; and he held his mother in his arms, and she kissed his mouth, and wept as blissfully as any one can weep for joy; and he nodded at every old piece of furniture in the room, at the cupboard with the tea-cups, and at the flower-vase.	H,H
crossing one’s arms	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now he had carved Holger Danske, who stood there erect and proud, with his long beard, holding in one hand his broad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the Danish arms.	N,N
crossing one’s arms	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then suddenly some one put his arm round my waist-' "'Yes, and you gave him a hearty smack on the cheek,' said the old man.	H,N
crossing one’s arms	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"And here is one, and there is another!" they all exclaimed; for there were crosses on all the doors in every direction.	Su-,Su-
crossing one’s arms	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little lady was a dancer, and she stretched out both her arms, and raised one of her legs so high, that the tin soldier could not see it at all, and he thought that she, like himself, had only one leg.	N,N
crossing one’s arms	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The whole of nature was one large holy church, in which the trees and hovering clouds formed the pillars, the flowers and grass the woven velvet carpet, and heaven itself was the great cupola; up there the flame colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared, but millions of stars were lighted; diamond lamps were shining, and the king's son stretched his arms out towards heaven, towards the sea, and towards the wood.	H,N
warm sweaty hands	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It gave a warm, bright light, like a little candle, as she held her hand over it.	N,N
warm sweaty hands	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pigling Bland warmed his hands, and eyed him.	N,N
warm sweaty hands	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The tailor sat down again by the fire, warming his poor cold hands.	N,N
warm sweaty hands	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Wait," said he, "I will warm you a little," and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man"s face, but he remained cold.	Su-,N
warm sweaty hands	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pigling Bland drew forward a coppy stool, and sat on the edge of it, shyly warming his hands.	N,N
warm sweaty hands	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	How the fire burned! and seemed so beautifully warm that the child stretched out her feet as if to warm them, when, lo! the flame of the match went out, the stove vanished, and she had only the remains of the half-burnt match in her hand.	Su-,N
increased strength or stamina	[('TERROR', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	As he grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth, so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, bright sun itself.	H,H
hyper-sensitivity to touch and sound	[('FEAR', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	All agreed that it must be so, except one who said that the bell was too small and too thin to be heard at such a distance, and that it had quite a different sound to that which had so touched men's hearts.	N,N
swinging the arms while walking	[('HAPPINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He then walked away towards the Metal Pig, half knelt down, clasped it with his arms, and then put his mouth to the shining snout and drank deep draughts of the fresh water.	N,N
swinging the arms while walking	[('HAPPINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He began to walk frightfully lame, holding Pig-wig's arm.	N,F
swinging the arms while walking	[('HAPPINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Farewell bright sun," she cried, stretching out her arm towards it; and then she walked a short distance from the house; for the corn had been cut, and only the dry stubble remained in the fields.	Sa,N
swinging the arms while walking	[('HAPPINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood.	H,H
illness	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They lived now for a while happy and contented with each other, and then it befell that the young Queen was attacked by a severe illness, and no physician could save her.	N,N
illness	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Just about this time, my dear sweet boy, who lies sleeping there, was born, and my husband was attacked with a severe lingering illness.	N,N
illness	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She had heard of the emperor's illness, and was therefore come to sing to him of hope and trust.	N,N
clamping the lips together	[('AMUSEMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, "When you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry "Jip!""	N,N
looking sleepy or glazed	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Sophy was lying in the drawer where Ida had placed her; but she looked very sleepy.	N,N
hiding one’s mouth behind a hand	[('GUILT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	At this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, "Throw the rascal up here!"	F,F
hiding one’s mouth behind a hand	[('GUILT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was hiding there.	N,N
biting one’s cheek	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One played the bassoon, the other the fiddle, and the third put the trumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly could.	N,N
biting one’s cheek	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It remained there a long time; but when at last it was brought forth it appeared as if something pleasant had happened, for every one was laughing; the furrier's daughter laughed too, but she said very little, and her cheeks were like two roses.	N,H
biting one’s cheek	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At the window of one of them sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks, and clear sparkling eyes, who was very fond of the old house, in sunshine or in moonlight.	N,H
biting one’s cheek	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then suddenly some one put his arm round my waist-' "'Yes, and you gave him a hearty smack on the cheek,' said the old man.	H,N
biting one’s cheek	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the dawn of morning there lay the poor little one, with pale cheeks and smiling mouth, leaning against the wall; she had been frozen to death on the last evening of the year; and the New-year's sun rose and shone upon a little corpse!	Su-,N
biting one’s cheek	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, "Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here," and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.	N,A
biting one’s cheek	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Red-head," said the soldiers, and little Peter laughed; but when one of them sometimes said to another, "Foxey," he would bite his teeth together and look another way- into the wide world.	N,N
biting one’s cheek	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.	H,H
hiding the face	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She folded her hands, and hid her face in the cotton curtains of the bed, and wept.	Sa,Sa
hiding the face	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, "Throw the rascal up here!"	F,F
hiding the face	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth.	N,Su+
arguing	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"You have slept soundly while I was arguing with the old man whether it was a story or a fairy tale!"	N,N
arguing	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Anna Maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw, and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!	Su-,Su-
arguing	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones.	A,A
arguing	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But it is unwise to argue with the police; he gave his brother a peppermint, and watched him out of sight.	N,N
losing track of time	[('DEPRESSION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	When night came she wanted to go home; and the king"s son would go with her, and said to himself, "I will not lose her this time"; but, however, she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped her left golden slipper upon the stairs.	F,N
losing track of time	[('DEPRESSION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	IT was late when Counsellor Knapp, lost in thought about the times of King Hans, desired to return home; and fate so ordered it that he put on the goloshes of Fortune instead of his own, and walked out into the East Street.	N,N
losing track of time	[('DEPRESSION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	They are not the lost whom the spectator sees, but the heathen of olden times.	N,N
losing track of time	[('DEPRESSION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	At last they both lost themselves in the thicket; Christina began to cry, and then Ib cried too; and, after weeping and lamenting for some time, they stretched themselves down on the dry leaves and fell asleep.	Sa,Sa
losing track of time	[('DEPRESSION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	It was- only think!- it was really the tin soldier, the very same which had been lost up in the old man's room, and had been hidden among old wood and rubbish for a long time, till it sunk into the earth, where it must have been for many years.	Su+,N
losing track of time	[('DEPRESSION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then the father fell into a rage and said: "Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes?	A,A
losing track of time	[('DEPRESSION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, "All is not right; someone took hold of my gown."	F,F
losing track of time	[('DEPRESSION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	'Bone for bone,' I thought; but they were so angry, and from that time I have been fastened with a chain, and lost my bone.	Sa,N
losing track of time	[('DEPRESSION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	People already called them "the betrothed," and at parting the girl showed Ib the two nuts, which she had taken care of ever since the time that they lost themselves in the wood; and she told him also that the little wooden shoes he once carved for her when he was a boy, and gave her as a present, had been carefully kept in a drawer ever since.	N,N
forcibly declaring that nothing’s going on we’re just friends	[('LOVE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one day, when the king"s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they were alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the prince said, "My friend, what is the matter with you?"	Sa,Sa
fidgeting instead of sitting or standing still	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then, if they behave well, they obtain permission to fly about during the day, instead of being obliged to sit still on their stems at home, and so in time their leaves become real wings.	N,N
fidgeting instead of sitting or standing still	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when he came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as if she was going to beat the boy.	N,N
fidgeting instead of sitting or standing still	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it.	N,H
fidgeting instead of sitting or standing still	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The smaller of the two represented a little boy sitting at a table, drawing; before him was a little white poodle, curiously shaven; but as the animal would not stand still, it had been fastened with a string to its head and tail, to keep it in one position.	N,N
wrinkling one’s nose	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the dogs fell upon the judges and all the councillors; seized one by the legs, and another by the nose, and tossed them many feet high in the air, so that they fell down and were dashed to pieces.	N,N
wrinkling one’s nose	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and at length said: "The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no consequence."	H,N
wrinkling one’s nose	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another.	A,N
shoving one’s hands into pockets	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Whenever he dozed, he dreamed that he had lost one or another of these possessions; then he would awake with a start, and the first movements of his hand formed a triangle from his right-hand pocket to his breast, and from his breast to his left-hand pocket, to feel whether they were all safe.	N,N
shoving one’s hands into pockets	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The son said: "Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower," and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.	H,H
shoving one’s hands into pockets	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise," "Well thrown," said the tailor, "but after all the stone came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come back at all," and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air.	H,N
arms swinging while walking	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He then walked away towards the Metal Pig, half knelt down, clasped it with his arms, and then put his mouth to the shining snout and drank deep draughts of the fresh water.	N,N
arms swinging while walking	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He began to walk frightfully lame, holding Pig-wig's arm.	N,F
arms swinging while walking	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Farewell bright sun," she cried, stretching out her arm towards it; and then she walked a short distance from the house; for the corn had been cut, and only the dry stubble remained in the fields.	Sa,N
arms swinging while walking	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood.	H,H
shoulders that drop or curl	[('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The snowflakes fell on her long, fair hair, which hung in curls on her shoulders, but she regarded them not.	N,N
arms tucking in at the sides	[('EMBARRASSMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Farewell, farewell," she repeated, twining her arm round a little red flower that grew just by her side.	Sa,N
arms tucking in at the sides	[('EMBARRASSMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then her voice came back to her, and she cried out loudly, "Yes, Mary, I did it;" and straight-way rain fell from the sky and extinguished the flames of fire, and a light broke forth above her, and the Virgin Mary descended with the two little sons by her side, and the new-born daughter in her arms.	F,F
arms tucking in at the sides	[('EMBARRASSMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up.	H,H
breaking into sobs	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Here everything was bright, and the boy knelt down by the first tomb on his right, the grave of Michael Angelo, and sobbed as if his heart would break.	Sa,Sa
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they tore of her dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it.	H,H
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The storm would not leave this little sentry-house alone, but must needs tear it from its fastenings, and roll it down the street; and, wonderfully enough, it stopped opposite to the door of the dirty journeyman plasterer, who had saved three lives at the last fire, but the sentry-house thought nothing of that.	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Oh, my poor mother!" he cried, while the tears rolled down his cheeks.	Sa,Sa
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Such tears as these cannot be washed out, even when the nightcap is forgotten.	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.	H,H
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It would be a sin to tear up a book like this.	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the sister cried, "Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wild beast, and tear me to pieces."	F,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A record of this bright display will live in the memory of man, for through it the pupil in the military school was in tears and sorrow.	Sa,Sa
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"No, she is mine," said the huntsman; "for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you and the princess into pieces."	A,A
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Oh, what bitter tears she shed! and she could not open her heart to any one for relief.	Sa,Sa
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little people who now play on that spot know nothing of the old tale, else would they fancy they heard a child crying deep below the earth, and the dewdrops on each blade of grass would be to them tears of woe.	H,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Let any one tear thy web, and thou wilt begin again and repair it.	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	We drank together of the waters of Parnassus, and dwelt for many years beneath the laurel roof of the hut, while, winter after winter, my mother sang her song of the stag who shed red tears.	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The faster he played, the more violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.	A,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They tore up trees in their sore need, and defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow."	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Peter was obliged to take the tailor out of heaven again, and as he had torn shoes, and feet covered with blisters, he took a stick in his hand, and went to "Wait-a-bit," where the good soldiers sit and make merry.	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Hold fast! hold fast!" the spectre would cry; and as Anne Lisbeth murmured these words to herself, the whole of her dream was suddenly recalled to her memory, when the mother had clung to her, and uttered these words, when, amid the crashing of worlds, her sleeve had been torn, and she had slipped from the grasp of her child, who wanted to hold her up in that terrible hour.	N,F
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The tears of her husband fell on her forehead, but she took no notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered.	Sa,Sa
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he tried him, his strength had increased so much that he could tear an old tree out of the ground.	N,N

tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the boy was already so strong that he tore up a young tree out of the earth by the roots.	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The other paid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time.	A,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And then they all hung on her, but there were too many; and as they clung the sleeve was torn, and Anne Lisbeth fell down in horror, and awoke.	F,F
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the clever servant had placed himself in the bed instead of his master, and when the maid came there, he tore off from her the mantle in which she had wrapped herself, and chased her out with rods.	A,N

eyes prickling with tears	[('NOSTALGIA', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	Mad with pain, he tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them far away, and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat.	A,A
eyes prickling with tears	[('NOSTALGIA', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before.	H,H
eyes prickling with tears	[('NOSTALGIA', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	Tears stood in his eyes, and glistened on his cheeks; he carried a great book and the binding was of velvet, with silver clasps.	Sa,Sa
cringing away from the source	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And all this about the two children was mirrored to old Anthony in a single tear, which could soon be wiped away and disappear, but might come again from its source in the heart of the old man.	Sa,N
arms hanging at one’s sides	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	If he went to a theatre of an evening, instead of enjoying himself he would be quite annoyed if the machinist had put too strong a light into one side of the moon, or if the representations of the sky hung over the scenes when they ought to have hung behind them; or if a palm-tree was introduced into a scene representing the Zoological Gardens of Berlin, or a cactus in a view of Tyrol, or a beech-tree in the north of Norway.	A,A
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Whenever he dozed, he dreamed that he had lost one or another of these possessions; then he would awake with a start, and the first movements of his hand formed a triangle from his right-hand pocket to his breast, and from his breast to his left-hand pocket, to feel whether they were all safe.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had put on the emperor's golden crown, and held in one hand his sword of state, and in the other his beautiful banner.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.	H,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The son said: "Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower," and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.	H,H
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They are embracing each other, and one little one stretches out his hand towards another who stands below him, and points to himself, as if he were saying, "I am going to heaven."	H,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now it chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out of her hand and fell into the well.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Presently I seized his hand: "Aphtanides," I exclaimed, "there is one thing still that you must know,- one thing that till now has been a secret between myself and Heaven.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was to be taken to the country to be buried there in his own grave; so they carried him away; no one followed him, for all his friends were dead; and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as the hearse moved away with it.	Sa,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little one stretched out her hand towards them, and the match went out.	Su-,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She expected, however, she should thus get rid of the tailor, for the bear had never yet left any one alive who had fallen into his clutches.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But as soon as she stepped into the cold water, a sudden faintness seized her; she clutched at the air convulsively with her hand, took one step forward, and fell.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out of her little daughter"s hand, and said, "You shall not have one before your brother."	A,A
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The king"s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone else came to ask her to dance, he said, "This lady is dancing with me."	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one.	H,H
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then a man took it up to remove it, and one of the bees stung him in the hand, so that he let the flower-pot fall, and it was broken to pieces.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy.	Su-,H
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now he had carved Holger Danske, who stood there erect and proud, with his long beard, holding in one hand his broad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the Danish arms.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"See," cried the youngest, "there is a new one;" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, "There is another swan come; a new one has arrived."	H,H
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered that each brick, when finished, brought him in a small coin, if only a copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one upon another, can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a person knocks, who has a number of these in his hands, whether it be the baker's, the butcher's, or the tailor's, the door flies open, and he can get all he wants.	Su+,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the youth took the plough, and just pressed it with one hand, but his grasp was so strong that the plough went deep into the earth.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he ran after him with the knife still in his hand, crying: "Just one, just one," meaning that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both.	F,Sa
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In her anger she clutched Rapunzel"s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground.	Su-,A
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on.	F,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Each one carried a burning taper in his hand, and one was given to me, as well as to little Anastasia.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It seemed too much for him to bear; and this happened not once, but many times; and at last one day he seized the delicate fingers and the white hand, and kissed it, and looked into her great brown eyes.	H,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And they ran towards each other and took one another's hand, in the great cathedral of nature and poesy, and above them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy spirits surrounded them, singing hallelujahs and rejoicing.	H,H
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah! the fool," answered the devil; "when any one comes and wants to go across he must put the oar in his hand, and the other man will have to ferry and he will be free."	H,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ferry me across first," said the luck-child, "and then I will tell you how you can be set free," and when he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil"s advice: "Next time any one comes, who wants to be ferried over, just put the oar in his hand."	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One of the branches of the tree had, however, been broken: mischievous hands must have done this in passing, for the tree now stood in a public thoroughfare.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the second girl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to the one who was on the King"s right hand, "Hilloa! hilloa!	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise," "Well thrown," said the tailor, "but after all the stone came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come back at all," and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air.	H,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The one who stood first in the rank was named the thumb, he was short and thick, and had only one joint in his back, and could therefore make but one bow; but he said that if he were cut off from a man's hand, that man would be unfit for a soldier.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, "I never saw any one half so beautiful."	H,H
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with the other took his son out of the horse"s ear, and put him down upon a straw, where he sat as merry as you please.	N,H
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The child still sat, in the stiffness of death, holding the matches in her hand, one bundle of which was burnt.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"However, there are quite enough left; I should very much like to examine these a little nearer, especially the moon, for that could not slip away under one's hands.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.	N,Su+
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower, and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he found his Jorinda again.	Su+,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, "When you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry "Jip!""	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the pendulum of the old clock went to and fro, and the hands turned round; and as time passed on, everything in the room grew older, but no one seemed to notice it.	N,N
crossing the legs	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might.	F,F
crossing the legs	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.	N,N
crossing the legs	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival rod seemed to grow larger and taller, and it turned round and said to the paper flowers, "How can you put such things in a child's head? they are all foolish fancies;" and then the doll was exactly like the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat, and looked as yellow and as cross as he did; but the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs, and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll.

gently biting the lip	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ida and Anna Dorothea wept bitterly, Joanna stood, pale and proud, biting her lips till the blood came; but what could that avail?	Sa,Sa

Su+,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Whenever he dozed, he dreamed that he had lost one or another of these possessions; then he would awake with a start, and the first movements of his hand formed a triangle from his right-hand pocket to his breast, and from his breast to his left-hand pocket, to feel whether they were all safe.

leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Quack, quack," cried she, and one after another the little ducklings jumped in.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	From one Shrove Tuesday to another, much may occur to weigh down the heart; it is the reckoning of a whole year; much may be forgotten, sins against heaven in word and thought, sins against our neighbor, and against our own conscience.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They whispered to one another about the taffeta lining and about little mouse tippets.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One tower after another fell, till at last only one remained standing on the hill where the castle had formerly been.	Su-,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So she tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself down and went to sleep.	H,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They often thought the last spark had come; and one would cry, "There goes the schoolmaster;" but the next moment another spark would appear, shining so beautifully.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They are embracing each other, and one little one stretches out his hand towards another who stands below him, and points to himself, as if he were saying, "I am going to heaven."	H,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Do you recollect that?" they asked one after another, thus bringing to his remembrance circumstances that made the perspiration stand on his brow.	N,F
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When one of the chickens was swallowed down, and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said: "What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what"s right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take another draught it would do me no harm."	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	On his return home, he became a master builder,- built one house after another in the town, till they formed quite a street, which, when finished, became really an ornament to the town.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One day he said to himself, "What shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect."	N,A
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	We converse in company with those we meet, as we converse with our fellow-travellers in a stage-coach, on a journey; we know nothing of them, and perhaps all the while we are incommoding one another, and each is wishing himself or his neighbor away.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They had little ones, and of course each one thought his own the handsomest and cleverest; one flew this way, another that, and when they met they recognised each other by their "Peep!" and the three scrapes with the left foot.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	By her side were statues, in which the spirit of life breathed in stone; figures of men, one of whom whetted his sword, and was named the Grinder; wrestling gladiators formed another group, the sword had been sharpened for them, and they strove for the goddess of beauty.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Before long her clothes were all torn, and one bit of them after another fell off her.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after another, crying, "There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you deserve; are you satisfied now!"	H,A
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the woman promised to lead the children to the right path, that they might find their way home: and they went forward certainly in quite another direction to the one they meant to take; therefore no one ought to speak against the woman, and say that she wanted to steal the children.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows, and how his master meant to kill him in the morning.	F,F
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One shoot after another sprouted forth, and little white buds blossomed, which the poor girl fondly kissed.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to him: "We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!"	H,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be parted from one another for ever.	Sa,Sa

leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	For a moment the little ones stood silent with astonishment, and then they shouted for joy, till the room rang, and they danced merrily round the tree, while one present after another was taken from it.	H,H
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One gave her goodness, another beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the world.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One flue seemed to lead into another.	N,N

leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One shooting star after another traversed the sky.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them.	Su+,H
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Each wanted to be first at drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home.	F,F
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone: "Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen"s window."	Sa,Sa
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the dogs fell upon the judges and all the councillors; seized one by the legs, and another by the nose, and tossed them many feet high in the air, so that they fell down and were dashed to pieces.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy.	Su-,H
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now he had carved Holger Danske, who stood there erect and proud, with his long beard, holding in one hand his broad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the Danish arms.	N,N

leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their hunger, and cried: "We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!"	H,H
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.	N,H
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And one day she sat and leaned her head against the flower-pot, and the little elf of the rose found her asleep.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They will hang one, And fry another; They will shoot a third, And roast his brother."	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Poor little creature!" they said, one after another, as they came up.	N,Sa
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered that each brick, when finished, brought him in a small coin, if only a copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one upon another, can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a person knocks, who has a number of these in his hands, whether it be the baker's, the butcher's, or the tailor's, the door flies open, and he can get all he wants.

leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"They will hang one, And roast another."	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they all got excited; they hit out with their wings, pecked with their beaks, and flop! one after another was thrown out of the nest.	A,A
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The pigeons strutted round one another, puffed out their chests mightily, and had their own private views and opinions.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another.	A,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The house, with its pointed gable, narrow windows, overhanging walls and stories, projecting one beyond another, looked just the same as in former times.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I wonder what those two Chinese are whispering about," whispered one duck to another; "they are always doing it, and it annoys me.	N,A
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now she could not say another word against the wedding because she had given a promise before every one, and the King ordered a carriage to be brought in which she was to drive to church with the tailor, and there she was to be married.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the dawn of morning there lay the poor little one, with pale cheeks and smiling mouth, leaning against the wall; she had been frozen to death on the last evening of the year; and the New-year's sun rose and shone upon a little corpse!	Su-,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Certainly it was rather crooked, rather up and down, one leg thick, and another thin; still it was like the copy, and he was overjoyed at what he had done.	H,H
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	First one window became broken, and then another, so that I could get in at other places besides the door.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The student, for whom my wife washes, says that when we die we shall fly from one star to another.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she said: "Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God"s good gifts be spoilt?"	H,H
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And they ran towards each other and took one another's hand, in the great cathedral of nature and poesy, and above them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy spirits surrounded them, singing hallelujahs and rejoicing.	H,H
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the window-sill stood a myrtle in a pot, and this had been pushed a little on one side, that it might not fall out; for the old maid was leaning out of the window, that she might see.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A third time he called out, "God be with you," and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between the three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so angrily with one another.	N,Su-

leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, "Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here," and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.	N,A
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight.	H,H
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"And here is one, and there is another!" they all exclaimed; for there were crosses on all the doors in every direction.	Su-,Su-
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,	H,H
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut open the monster"s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole.	N,Su+
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the king made the most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden, like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a thousand furs was made.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah! well," said she, "when one goes another may as well follow."	D,Su-
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on the breast of one of the giants.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the months followed one another, and first the trees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly intertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Every one admires the beauty of the apple-bough; but this humble flower has been endowed by Heaven with another kind of loveliness; and although they differ in appearance, both are the children of the realms of beauty."	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The pictures did not follow one another in order, as the circumstances they represented had occurred; very often the most painful would come together, and when those came which were most full of joy, they had always the deepest shadow thrown upon them.	Sa,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Red-head," said the soldiers, and little Peter laughed; but when one of them sometimes said to another, "Foxey," he would bite his teeth together and look another way- into the wide world.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He went and listened, and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The silk dresses rustled, the leather repeated its rhyme, and the old chairs had the gout in their backs, and cried, "Creak;" it was all exactly like the first time; for in that house, one day and one hour were just like another.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The emperor undressed, and the swindlers pretended to put the new suit upon him, one piece after another; and the emperor looked at himself in the glass from every side.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And then suddenly they all ran away together down the passage behind the wainscot, squeaking and calling to one another as they ran from house to house.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried, "Peep, peep."	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the grandfather nodded to a place above the looking-glass, where hung an almanac, with a representation of the Round Tower upon it, and said "Tycho Brahe was another of those who used a sword, but not one to cut into the flesh and bone, but to make the way of the stars of heaven clear, and plain to be understood.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party.	N,N

leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Heaven knows that I have done nothing myself, but what I was obliged to do with my weak powers for my own preservation; and yet I have been promoted from one joy and honor to another.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In olden times, Hauschen Street was not paved, and passengers would stumble out of one hole into another, as they generally do in unfrequented highways; and the street was so narrow, and the booths leaning against each other were so close together, that in the summer time a sail would be stretched across the street from one booth to another opposite.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In Denmark, in one of those green islands where the foliage of the beech-woods rustles in the wind, and where many Huns' graves may be seen, was another poor boy born.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She went to the tulips and began cutting them off, one after another.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It can be opened and explained, so that people may understand how the waltzes are formed, and why one note follows upon another."	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	How happy and delighted the little boy was; and after he returned home, and while days and weeks passed, a great deal of nodding took place from one house to the other, and then the little boy went to pay another visit.	H,H
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The space between the heavenly bodies is, to thought, no farther than the distance which we may have to walk from one friend's house to another in the same town; yet this electric shock obliges us to use our bodies here below, unless, like the watchman, we have on the goloshes of Fortune.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, "All is not right; someone took hold of my gown."	F,F
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they said, "The old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one in when we are away."	A,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	No one was in the street but himself; it belonged only to him, so he boldly seated himself on the pig's back, leaned forward so that his curly head could rest on the head of the animal, and, before he was aware, he fell asleep.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One of them doesn't understand another.	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb.	A,A
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But how comes it that one relation is always harder towards another than even strangers would be?	N,N
leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"First, let all the twelve come to me," said the captain on duty, "one after another.	N,N

relief	[('SYMPATHY', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	One night, when her husband listened, as he often did, to her breathing, he quite believed that she had at length found rest and relief in sleep.	N,N
relief	[('SYMPATHY', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family.	H,H
relief	[('SYMPATHY', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Oh, what bitter tears she shed! and she could not open her heart to any one for relief.	Sa,Sa
relief	[('SYMPATHY', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	He thought of all those who had once suffered from starvation, of Saint Elizabeth, who once wandered on the earth, the saint of his home and his childhood, the noble Duchess of Thuringia, that highly esteemed lady who visited the poorest villages, bringing hope and relief to the sick inmates.

relief	[('SYMPATHY', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	It was a mental relief when Sophy, one of her friends, came to pay them a visit.	N,N
stalking off to get some air	[('ANNOYANCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The wind roars in upon it through windows and loopholes; and the wind knows everything, for he gets it from the air, which encircles all things, and the church bell understands his tongue, and rings it out into the world, 'Ding-dong! ding-dong!'	H,N
stalking off to get some air	[('ANNOYANCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then he opened the window to get some fresh air, but before he was aware, the head-servant had given him such a kick that he flew through the window out into the air, and so far away that no one ever saw him again.	N,N
stalking off to get some air	[('ANNOYANCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	In one pot pinks were growing all over the sides, at least the green leaves were shooting forth stalk and stem, and saying as plainly as they could speak, "The air has fanned me, the sun has kissed me, and I am promised a little flower for next Sunday- really for next Sunday."	N,N
stalking off to get some air	[('ANNOYANCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They have flown off their stalks into the air, and flap their leaves as if they were little wings to make them fly.	N,N
stalking off to get some air	[('ANNOYANCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And they hovered about there in the air, and could not get to each other, and whether they are still hovering about, or not, I do not know, but the young giant took up his iron bar, and went on his way.	N,N
stalking off to get some air	[('ANNOYANCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air.	A,N
stalking off to get some air	[('ANNOYANCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Yes, father," answered he; "I have travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again."	H,H
stalking off to get some air	[('ANNOYANCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The air was dark with flying tiles; old wood-work crashed and fell; and a wheelbarrow ran up the streets all alone, only to get out of the way.	N,N
stalking off to get some air	[('ANNOYANCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But he threw quilts and pillows up in the air, got out and said: "Now anyone who likes, may drive," and lay down by his fire, and slept till it was day.	N,N
lying or misleading others	[('DOUBT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And so it happened that this stone was not cut in two as many others had been, but now lies in the courtyard below, a scouring block for the maids, and a playground for the children.	N,N
lying or misleading others	[('DOUBT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	So they gave him a mouthful of food outside, and at night, when they went to rest, the two others would not let him have a bed, and at last he was forced to creep into the goose-house, and lie down on a little hard straw.	N,N
lying or misleading others	[('DOUBT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Then the others went to the bailiff, and told him that the head-man was still lying in bed, and would not go into the wood with them.	N,N
an easy walk unhurried	[('PEACEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then up he got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till he reached his mother"s house, and told her how very easy the road to good luck was.	H,H
time feeling like it’s slowing down	[('ANXIETY', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: "Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much."	F,Su-
biting the lips to keep from smiling	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Several of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing, and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in keeping his countenance, but the smile on his lips faded away; for he caught sight of a pair of dark-blue eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady.

asking questions how long when what is it	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pig- wig's gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland.	N,H
asking questions how long when what is it	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She certainly might have asked more sensible questions; but if she had not been allowed to say just what she liked, would her daughter have been there, leaning so gracefully on her shoulder, and looking straight before her, with a smile that was almost mournful on her face?	N,N
asking questions how long when what is it	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He asked several questions about the wood and about the exact position of the house and shed.	N,N
asking questions how long when what is it	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Are you ill? where do you live? have you been here all day?" were some of the questions asked by the old man.	N,N

asking questions how long when what is it	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: "I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening.	H,Sa
asking questions how long when what is it	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At the church door stood an old crippled soldier leaning on a crutch; he had a wonderfully long beard, more red than white, and he bowed down to the ground and asked the old lady whether he might wipe her shoes.	N,N
asking questions how long when what is it	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And so, on every summer day the dance was repeated, the same questions asked, and the same answers given.	N,N
asking questions how long when what is it	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he called one of his lords-in-waiting, who was so high-bred, that when any in an inferior rank to himself spoke to him, or asked him a question, he would answer, "Pooh," which means nothing.	D,N
losing one’s voice from screaming or shouting	[('ELATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Delightful indeed," cried a voice quite near to them; no one but the tin soldier saw that it came from a rag of the leather which hung in tatters; it had lost all its gilding, and looked like wet earth, but it had an opinion, and it spoke it thus:-	N,N
a need to touch and explore	[('DESIRE', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	We will set it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are really in need of it."	N,N
a need to touch and explore	[('DESIRE', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	First they peeped into the basket containing the eels and the sucking-pig; then they must needs pull out the pig and take it in their hands, and feel it, and touch it; and as they both wanted to hold it at the same time, the consequence was that they let it fall into the water, and the pig sailed away with the stream.	Su-,N
heat flushing through the body	[('ANGER', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	Her powers of body were almost exhausted, but her eyes flashed brightly, and on her cheeks was a rosy flush.	N,N
changing the topic to bring others into the spotlight	[('CONFIDENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough, and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a change, and to try some other way of arranging the work.	A,A
shaking one’s head in denial	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Let me see him," said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, "It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy."	H,H
shaking one’s head in denial	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said, "No, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, I might very soon go begging myself.	D,N
tenseness in one’s stomach	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.	Su-,Su-
tenseness in one’s stomach	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	This bottle would hold so much more than the little one, and they all said the brandy would be so good for complaints of the stomach, especially as it was mixed with medical herbs.	N,N
tenseness in one’s stomach	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone: "Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen"s window."	Sa,Sa
tenseness in one’s stomach	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	It was a glorious spectacle; but the stomachs of the travellers were empty, their bodies exhausted with fatigue, and all the longings of their heart turned towards a resting-place for the night; but where to find one they knew not.

tenseness in one’s stomach	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	Then the kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut open the monster"s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole.

laughing	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	This was a very rude speech, especially against the cask; but the huckster and the student both laughed, for it was only said in fun.	H,N
laughing	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round.

laughing	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The witty little duck said of the Portuguese, that the old lady was getting quite a "doting ducky," All the other ducks laughed at this.	N,D

laughing	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and jewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the people laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in snow.	N,Sa
laughing	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So she took him by the wrist, and he laughed till he nearly choked; and when she came to the fourth finger, there was a gold ring on it, as if it knew there was to be a betrothal.	H,H

poor sleep	[('EMBARRASSMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When they had had supper and it was bed-time, the woman called her husband apart and said, "Hark you, dear husband, let us make up a bed of straw for ourselves to-night, and then the poor traveler can sleep in our bed and have a good rest, for he has been walking the whole day through, and that makes one weary."

jerking the head back	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The ass placed himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog"s shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat"s head.	N,N
jerking the head back	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They all asked what he desired, so he said he wished to get above ground back to daylight, on which they seized him by every hair that grew on his head, and thus they flew with him onto the earth again.	N,N
jerking the head back	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he tried to pull his head back again, but without success; he could move his neck about easily enough, and that was all.	N,N

jerking the head back	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	No one thanked him for the offer, and I saw the ruined old gentleman lift his head, and throw it back more proudly than ever.	N,N
jerking the head back	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, "I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will soon have a daughter."	H,H
jerking the head back	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She had been sitting in her arm-chair, telling us a long, beautiful tale; and when it was finished, she said she was tired, and leaned her head back to sleep awhile.	N,N

creating chance run ins	[('ADORATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, "Let that alone till the morning, and heat the king"s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don"t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again."	N,A
turning away to gather one’s thoughts	[('CONFUSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the little ship sailed away; sometimes the current of the water seized it, but whenever it went too far from the shore one of the boys turned up his trousers, and went in after it, and brought it back to land.	N,N
turning away to gather one’s thoughts	[('CONFUSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one of her servants, and said, "Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood, that I may never see her any more."	A,A

muscles jumping under the skin	[('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.	F,N
becoming unnaturally quiet or still	[('GUILT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Two feathers which the fluttering ducks had lost floated up and down; suddenly they took a rush as if the wind were coming, but as it did not come they had to lie still, and the water once more became quiet and smooth.	N,N
hiding behind a book	[('EMBARRASSMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was hiding there.

dizziness seeing black spots	[('TERROR', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	I lay looking at the cloud till I observed a little black spot in the middle of it, which gradually grew larger and larger, and then I knew what it meant- I am old and experienced; and although this token is not often seen, I knew it, and a shuddering seized me.

rage	[('PARANOIA', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then he became mad and blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without touching the bird at all.

wanting to face the consequences	[('REMORSE', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	First they peeped into the basket containing the eels and the sucking-pig; then they must needs pull out the pig and take it in their hands, and feel it, and touch it; and as they both wanted to hold it at the same time, the consequence was that they let it fall into the water, and the pig sailed away with the stream.

hiding a smile behind a hand	[('SATISFACTION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	At this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, "Throw the rascal up here!"

breaking down tears	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.	Sa,Sa
breaking down tears	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	I will break down the apple-tree, and tear it up by the roots; never more shall it blossom or bear fruit."	A,N

a bubbly or light voice	[('HAPPINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Only a faint glimmer of light struggled through the horn panes in the little window on the roof, while within sat the old clerk, generally on his bed, singing his evening hymn in a low voice; or he would be moving about in his booth till late in the night, busily employed in many things.

running away	[('HURT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon."

F,F
running away	[('HURT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Thus she went on and on, and journeyed till she came to the world"s end; then she came to the sun, but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, "I smell flesh and blood this way!" so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a little piece of wood, and said, "If you have not this little piece of wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain, and there your brothers live."

running away	[('HURT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The peasant, however, said: "Don"t tell me that," and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.	A,A
running away	[('HURT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran faster than she, and stuck close to the steak.	N,N
running away	[('HURT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	So she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying away.	F,N

cutting people off	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the ropes which held it were cut through, and the aerial ship rose in the air with the aeronaut and the basket containing the bottle and the rabbit, while the music sounded and all the people shouted "Hurrah."	H,N
trying to see and hear everything at once	[('WARINESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	At last the luck-child got home to his wife, who was heartily glad to see him again, and to hear how well he had prospered in everything.	H,N
holding one’s head in hands	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had put on the emperor's golden crown, and held in one hand his sword of state, and in the other his beautiful banner.	N,N
holding one’s head in hands	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.	H,N
holding one’s head in hands	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Will you be quiet? or I'll break your screaming head;" and she swung about the fire-pot which she held in her hand, while the boy crouched to the earth and screamed.	A,F
holding one’s head in hands	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.	N,Su+
holding one’s head in hands	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There they lay with their anger, holding their heads on one side and blinking the eye that was turned upwards.	A,A
holding one’s head in hands	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now he had carved Holger Danske, who stood there erect and proud, with his long beard, holding in one hand his broad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the Danish arms.	N,N
holding one’s head in hands	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She would hold my head between her hands, and sing the songs she never sang at other times, for the Turks, our masters, would not allow it.	H,N
holding one’s head in hands	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside, and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child"s head off.	F,N
holding one’s head in hands	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, "I never saw any one half so beautiful."	H,H
holding one’s head in hands	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with the other took his son out of the horse"s ear, and put him down upon a straw, where he sat as merry as you please.	N,H
holding one’s head in hands	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The child still sat, in the stiffness of death, holding the matches in her hand, one bundle of which was burnt.	N,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Then he closed the lid, seated the dog upon it again, and walked into another chamber, And, sure enough, there sat the dog with eyes as big as mill-wheels.	N,N

briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Suddenly a feeling of fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep, that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him.	Su-,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	She was laid in a black coffin, looking mild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen, though her eyes were closed; but every wrinkle had vanished, her hair looked white and silvery, and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile.	H,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	It has been raised from only a little sprig of myrtle that you gave me on the day after my betrothal, and from which I was to make my own bridal bouquet when a year had passed: but that day never came; the eyes were closed which were to have been my light and joy through life.

briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	How gentle and sweet he looks as he lies there with his eyes closed!	N,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Several of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing, and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in keeping his countenance, but the smile on his lips faded away; for he caught sight of a pair of dark-blue eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady.	N,H
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree-- there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.	F,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	She sang successfully through three or four verses, only at every verse her head nodded a little lower, and her little twinkly eyes closed up--	N,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	A pious, faithful soul closed her eyes for ever; she was the pastor's wife. ..."If any one shall find rest in the grave and mercy before our Lord you shall certainly do so," said the pastor.	N,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	They disputed about it for a time, but as they were weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more.	A,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Close by her galloped four snorting steeds, with fire flashing from their eyes and nostrils.	N,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	They closed their eyes and- and- Well, now the story is ended!	N,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And she drew the curtains close round the little bed, so that the sun might not shine in their eyes.	N,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"Bring her the loveliest rose in the world; one which exhibits the purest and brightest love, and if it is brought to her before her eyes close, she will not die."	N,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Then before the eyes of little Tuk appeared a confusion of colors, red and green; but it cleared off, and he could distinguish a cliff close to the bay, the slopes of which were quite overgrown with verdure, and on its summit stood a fine old church with pointed towers.	N,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	At the nearest corner, a lamp hung before a picture of the Madonna; but the light it gave was almost useless, for he only perceived it when he came quite close and his eyes fell on the painted figures of the Mother and Child.	N,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.	N,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	A little spider, which he could however not see, busily and cheerfully spun its web above him, so that there should be a kind of little banner waving over the old man, when his eyes closed.	N,H
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	But in front of the tan-yard, close to the entrance, stood a little girl clothed in rags, very pretty to look at, with curly hair, and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look into them.	H,N
briefly closing the eyes	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill," said one of the lizards; "I have not been able to close my eyes for two nights on account of the noise; I might just as well have had the toothache, for that always keeps me awake."	A,A
leading rather than following	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun.	H,N
leading rather than following	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Not in my opinion," said the fourth; "I will never follow the lead of others, and only imitate what they have done.	D,N
leading rather than following	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When evening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into his chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: "I have followed thee seven years.	N,N
leading rather than following	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And as the old grandfather's spirit followed the next hovering flame, he knew whither it would lead him.	N,N
leading rather than following	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, "All is not right; someone took hold of my gown."	F,F
leading rather than following	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He followed the child to the wretched house, and ascended the narrow, crazy staircase which led to a little garret in the roof.	N,N
self-hugging to contain the feeling	[('ELATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Many pass this picture by with indifference, and yet it contains a treasure of poetic feeling; it represents Christ descending into Hades.	N,N
hesitation	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('WARINESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	His eyes brightened, and the words he uttered came with hesitation from his lips, but from the deepest recesses of his heart: "Christina, if you have not become too grand, and if you can be contented to live in my mother's house as my wife, we will be married some day.	H,H
hesitation	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('WARINESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	My brother liked the stranger so much that he begged him to spend a couple of days with us, to which, after some hesitation, he consented.	N,H
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The old woman spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter into her service.	H,H
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot.	F,N
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As she did not know how to help herself, she ordered her maid to creep into the lord"s sleeping-chamber, and listen to his dreams, and thought that he would perhaps speak in his sleep and discover the riddle.	N,N
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	You must take pains to grow, for it is not every one who has sealing-wax dropped upon him;" and as she spoke, the darning-needle drew herself up so proudly that she fell out of the handkerchief right into the sink, which the cook was cleaning.	N,N
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Whilst he was sitting there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the king"s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still, or had perished.	Sa,Sa
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And while she was speaking, the child plucked off quite a large apple, and ran to her sisters, saying, "Just taste, my dear little sisters, for never in my life have I tasted anything so delightful."	H,H
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The old woman was as good as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and boiled meats every day.	H,N
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The boy cried a second time: "What do you want here?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the steps!"	A,N
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She sat in splendid rooms, richly decorated with silk and velvet; not a breath of air was allowed to blow upon her, and no one was allowed to speak to her harshly, for she was nurse to the count's child.	N,N
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to herself: "He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the world," she spoke to him in a friendly way.	H,N
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Scarcely had he spoken these words when he heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as black as coal flying round and round.	N,N
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He became at last desperate; and when one of them said he was tipsy, he did not doubt the man's word in the least- only begged them to get a droschky; and then they thought he was speaking the Muscovite language.	N,N
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Delightful indeed," cried a voice quite near to them; no one but the tin soldier saw that it came from a rag of the leather which hung in tatters; it had lost all its gilding, and looked like wet earth, but it had an opinion, and it spoke it thus:-	N,N
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now, we can speak our language over the whole earth- up in the North and in Egypt.	N,N
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He stood still and looked at her full of surprise, then he spoke to her and said, "Who art thou?	Su+,Su+
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Not for gold or silver, but for flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom in his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood."	N,N
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She felt very low-spirited, because her count-child had shown no inclination to speak to her who loved him so well, and who had travelled so far to see him.	Sa,Sa
speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Sometimes he came to one of the windows and looked out; then the little boy nodded to him, and the old man nodded back again, till they became acquainted, and were friends, although they had never spoken to each other; but that was of no consequence.	N,N

speaking only when spoken to	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the woman promised to lead the children to the right path, that they might find their way home: and they went forward certainly in quite another direction to the one they meant to take; therefore no one ought to speak against the woman, and say that she wanted to steal the children.

shifting in one’s chair	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate, a tumbler, a knife and fork, salt cellar, mustard and a chair-- in short, preparations for one person's supper.	N,N
shifting in one’s chair	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The silk dresses rustled, the leather repeated its rhyme, and the old chairs had the gout in their backs, and cried, "Creak;" it was all exactly like the first time; for in that house, one day and one hour were just like another.	N,N
shifting in one’s chair	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was stirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the egg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep, and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord"s easy chair and the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept away as softly as possible.	N,N
not speaking or making any sound	[('HUMILIATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Long after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard a raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice.	N,N
not speaking or making any sound	[('HUMILIATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Then suddenly the sound of the bell was heard so beautifully and solemnly from the wood that four or five made up their minds to go still further on.	N,N

happiness over a job well done	[('SATISFACTION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Soon afterwards the children and grandchildren came, for they knew very well that it was the golden wedding-day; they had already wished them joy and happiness in the morning, but the old people had forgotten it, although they remembered things so well that had passed many, many years ago.	N,N
happiness over a job well done	[('SATISFACTION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Everything invited to slumber, everything had a charming look of repose; and so the nurse had discovered, for she slept; and well she might sleep, while everything around her told of happiness and blessing.	H,N
happiness over a job well done	[('SATISFACTION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"Yes," said the Lord, he might, but it would not be to his advantage, and he had better not wish for anything; but the rich man thought that he could easily ask for something which would add to his happiness, if he only knew that it would be granted.	N,N
happiness over a job well done	[('SATISFACTION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	So his wife went and asked the poor man, and he said to her, "Yesterday evening a traveler came here and asked for a night"s lodging, and this morning when he took leave of us he granted us three wishes---eternal happiness, health during this life and our daily bread as well, and besides this, a beautiful new house instead of our old hut."

looking down while walking	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	While musing on this strange affair, and without looking to the right or left, he walked on through East Street and over Highbridge Place.	N,N
looking down while walking	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.	N,H
looking down while walking	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The rich drove, the poor walked, but the way seemed to them extraordinarily long, and when they arrived at a number of willow trees on the border of the wood they sat down, looked up into the great branches and thought they were now really in the wood.	N,N
looking down while walking	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A person could walk up and down for a whole day through the streets, and tire himself out with looking at the pictures; and then he would know all about what people lived in the houses, for they had hung out their shields or signs; and, as grandfather said, it was a very instructive thing, in a great town, to know at once who the inhabitants were.	N,N
looking down while walking	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: "See, Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round?	N,N
looking down while walking	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!	N,N
looking down while walking	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood.	H,H
looking down while walking	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He walked about in a coat embroidered all over, and in the drawing-rooms of society looked just like one of those rich pearl-embroidered bell-pulls, which are only made for show; and behind them always hangs a good thick cord for use.	N,N
looking down while walking	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then a man approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could see the gallows, the man said to him: "Look, there is the tree where seven men have married the ropemaker"s daughter, and are now learning how to fly.	N,N
looking down while walking	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The mother and son were walking in the churchyard when they discovered the old bell, and they stood still to look at it.	N,N

looking down while walking	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"'But first we went to school to learn something,' she said, 'and then we were confirmed; we both wept on that day, but in the afternoon we went out hand in hand, and ascended the high round tower and looked out into the wide world right over Copenhagen and the sea; then we walked to Fredericksburg, where the king and the queen were sailing about in their magnificent boat on the canals.'	N,Sa
looking down while walking	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Look, I am lame, and have blisters on my feet with walking here, I cannot possibly turn back again.	Sa,N
deep breaths	[('SADNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the counsellor leaned his head on his hand, drew a deep breath, and pondered over all the strange things that had happened to him.	N,N

stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Here, behind the white iron railings, once a rose-tree grew; it is gone now, but a little bit of evergreen, from a neighboring grave, stretches out its green tendrils, and makes some appearance; there rests a very unhappy man, and yet while he lived he might be said to occupy a very good position.

stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The tree felt itself stretching and spreading out, while through the root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of life.	N,H

stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The pastor raised himself in bed and stretched his arms towards her, saying, "Not even you can find eternal rest!	Su-,Su-

stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last they both lost themselves in the thicket; Christina began to cry, and then Ib cried too; and, after weeping and lamenting for some time, they stretched themselves down on the dry leaves and fell asleep.	Sa,Sa
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Let them come," said the boy, "I am not afraid; but I am so tired that I cannot go any farther:" and he stretched himself upon a bench and fell asleep.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There it lay stretched on the snow-covered shore, and over it sounded the notes of a song from the ship- a song of Christmas joy, and of the redemption of the soul of man, and of eternal life through Christ's atoning blood.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"If I could only get some, too," thought Little Claus; and then, as he stretched his neck towards the window he spied a large, beautiful pie,- indeed they had a glorious feast before them.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer than seven, dead and with legs stretched out.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the ground, as if she was quite dead.	Sa,Sa
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I can endure it no longer," said he; "how beautiful it looks when it stretches out its tongue?"	A,Sa
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They floated on swiftly, for the tide was in their favor, passing over lakes, formed by the stream in its course; sometimes they seemed quite enclosed by reeds and water-plants, yet there was always room for them to pass out, although the old trees overhung the water and the old oaks stretched out their bare branches, as if they had turned up their sleeves and wished to show their knotty, naked arms.	H,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Eccellenza, miserabili!" they exclaimed, stretching forth their diseased limbs.	Sa,Su-

stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"'Yes, to-day is your golden wedding-day,' said the little elder-tree mother, stretching her head down between the two old people, who thought that she was their neighbour who was nodding to them; they looked at each other and clasped hands.	H,N

stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the neighborhood of Eisenach stretches a ridge of stony mountains, one of which has a rounded outline, and shows itself above the rest without tree, bush, or grass on its barren summits.	N,N

stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Far in the interior of the wood, where a noisy swarm of laborers were working, stood Waldemar Daa and his three daughters, and all were laughing at the wild cries of the birds, excepting one, the youngest, Anna Dorothea, who felt grieved to the heart; and when they made preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead, and on whose naked branches the black stork had built her nest, she saw the poor little things stretching out their necks, and she begged for mercy for them, with the tears in her eyes.

stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The ambassador remained standing by the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, and then conveyed to him this proposal.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said: "Pull off my boots," and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them.	A,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself.	F,F
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The whole of nature was one large holy church, in which the trees and hovering clouds formed the pillars, the flowers and grass the woven velvet carpet, and heaven itself was the great cupola; up there the flame colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared, but millions of stars were lighted; diamond lamps were shining, and the king's son stretched his arms out towards heaven, towards the sea, and towards the wood.	H,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Here the maiden opened the lid, and it was marvellous to behold how the castle, the houses, and the farm buildings which were enclosed, stretched themselves out and grew to their natural size with the greatest rapidity.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the dog stretched himself out on the road, and fell fast asleep.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	This rang pleasantly in the tailor"s ears; he stretched his delicate head out of the window, and called: "Come up here, dear woman; here you will get rid of your goods."	H,H

stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In olden times, Hauschen Street was not paved, and passengers would stumble out of one hole into another, as they generally do in unfrequented highways; and the street was so narrow, and the booths leaning against each other were so close together, that in the summer time a sail would be stretched across the street from one booth to another opposite.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The world does not deserve to be made acquainted with my adventures, for it ought to have given me golden shoes when the emperor's horse was shod, and I stretched out my feet to be shod, too.	D,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it under.	F,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"You are killing the unfortunate man," said the pastor, and as he stretched out his hand to protect him who already suffered too much, the scene changed.	Sa,Su-

stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, "I will help you; lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be dead."	N,H
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The sea, the great majestic sea, which was rolling its long waves against the shore, stretched out before him, and the sun was standing like a large bright altar and there where sea and heaven met- all melted together in the most glowing colours; the wood was singing, and his heart too.	N,H
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Do you imagine this is the whole world?" asked the mother; "Wait till you have seen the garden; it stretches far beyond that to the parson's field, but I have never ventured to such a distance.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Farewell bright sun," she cried, stretching out her arm towards it; and then she walked a short distance from the house; for the corn had been cut, and only the dry stubble remained in the fields.	Sa,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little lady was a dancer, and she stretched out both her arms, and raised one of her legs so high, that the tin soldier could not see it at all, and he thought that she, like himself, had only one leg.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The straw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge.	F,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the little boy looked at the teapot; the lid rose up gradually, the elder-tree blossoms sprang forth one by one, fresh and white; long boughs came forth; even out of the spout they grew up in all directions, and formed a bush- nay, a large elder tree, which stretched its branches up to the bed and pushed the curtains aside; and there were so many blossoms and such a sweet fragrance!

stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the King looked kindly at her, stretched out his hand, and said, "Will you go with me to my palace and be my dear wife?"	H,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One drop of blood, one single drop, came out of the white feathers of the angel's wings and fell upon the ship in which the prince sat, burnt into it, and weighed upon it like thousands of hundredweights, dragging it rapidly down to the earth again; the strong wings of the eagles gave way, the wind roared round the prince's head, and the clouds around- were they formed by the smoke rising up from the burnt cities?- took strange shapes, like crabs many, many miles long, which stretched their claws out after him, and rose up like enormous rocks, from which rolling masses dashed down, and became fire-spitting dragons.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	IN the forest that extends from the banks of the Gudenau, in North Jutland, a long way into the country, and not far from the clear stream, rises a great ridge of land, which stretches through the wood like a wall.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But suddenly it seemed to her that there stood on the threshold a beautiful young form, as beautiful as the count's child, and this apparition said to her, "The world is passing away; hold fast to me, for you are my mother after all; you have an angel in heaven, hold me fast;" and the child-angel stretched out his hand and seized her.	N,N
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried: "Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon be fat."	N,A
stretching	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.

clinging to loved ones	[('WORRY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The mother, however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the family.	N,H

nodding to others in greeting	[('PEACEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she saw a large purple crocus jump into the middle of the table where the playthings stood, go up to the doll's bedstead and draw back the curtains; there lay the sick flowers, but they got up directly, and nodded to the others as a sign that they wished to dance with them.

nodding to others in greeting	[('PEACEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The elder-tree smelt strongly, and the setting sun illuminated the faces of the two old people, so that they looked quite rosy; the youngest of the grandchildren danced round them, and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening, for they were to have hot potatoes; and the elder mother nodded in the tree and cried 'Hooray' with the others."

turning away from others	[('AGITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As she turned to walk away, much came into her mind that she had heard in her childhood: old superstitions of spectres by the sea-shore; of the ghosts of drowned but unburied people, whose corpses had been washed up on the desolate beach.	N,F
turning away from others	[('AGITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the mother and both the sisters were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his horse, and rode away with her.	A,A
turning away from others	[('AGITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the little ship sailed away; sometimes the current of the water seized it, but whenever it went too far from the shore one of the boys turned up his trousers, and went in after it, and brought it back to land.	N,N
turning away from others	[('AGITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and turned to run away.	F,F
turning away from others	[('AGITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Some of them ran away, the others he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond.	A,N

taking a deep breath	[('FRUSTRATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Then the youth took the plough, and just pressed it with one hand, but his grasp was so strong that the plough went deep into the earth.	N,N
taking a deep breath	[('FRUSTRATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven, with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague, the ugly heavy stone.	H,H
taking a deep breath	[('FRUSTRATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him, and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and took a deep draught.	N,N
taking a deep breath	[('FRUSTRATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	A number of people, consisting of seamen, Copenhagen citizens, and a few scholars, sat in deep conversation over their mugs, and took very little notice of the new comer.	N,N
taking a deep breath	[('FRUSTRATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Then the counsellor leaned his head on his hand, drew a deep breath, and pondered over all the strange things that had happened to him.	N,N
taking a deep breath	[('FRUSTRATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	She replied, "Go farther into the wood until you come to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and drink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into a deep sleep, and will not be able to help me.

walking out of the room	[('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Well, well," he said; and with that he walked out of the room.	D,N
walking out of the room	[('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the bailiff heard that, he was seriously alarmed and quite beside himself; he walked backwards and forwards in the room, and drops of perspiration ran down from his forehead.	F,N
walking out of the room	[('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Down in that narrow lane, in a low cellar, lived a poor sick boy; he had been afflicted from his childhood, and even in his best days he could just manage to walk up and down the room on crutches once or twice, but no more.	Sa,N
walking out of the room	[('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don"t forget to say, "Good morning", and don"t peep into every corner before you do it."	N,N
holding a plate of food but not eating it	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now the little dwarf was getting their dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had brought with her fall into the last glass.	Sa,N
yelling or shouting	[('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The crows, ravens and magpies started up in terror at the yelling and shouting that sounded around.	N,N
squeezing the hands at one’s sides	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.	N,Su+
squeezing the hands at one’s sides	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the second girl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to the one who was on the King"s right hand, "Hilloa! hilloa!	N,N
a heavy feeling in the stomach	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone: "Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen"s window."	Sa,Sa
wandering a short distance away before returning	[('CONFUSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The old bell was, after a time, carried away to a greater distance than any one, even the warder in the bell tower, ever imagined; and the bell in the breast of the young man was heard in countries where his feet had never wandered.	N,N
being at ease with the world content	[('HAPPINESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.	Sa,Sa
an inability to sleep or eat	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights.	H,N
an inability to sleep or eat	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The frog said, "I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball again."	H,H
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Whenever he dozed, he dreamed that he had lost one or another of these possessions; then he would awake with a start, and the first movements of his hand formed a triangle from his right-hand pocket to his breast, and from his breast to his left-hand pocket, to feel whether they were all safe.	N,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had put on the emperor's golden crown, and held in one hand his sword of state, and in the other his beautiful banner.	N,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.	H,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The son said: "Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower," and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.

wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They are embracing each other, and one little one stretches out his hand towards another who stands below him, and points to himself, as if he were saying, "I am going to heaven."	H,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now it chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out of her hand and fell into the well.	N,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Presently I seized his hand: "Aphtanides," I exclaimed, "there is one thing still that you must know,- one thing that till now has been a secret between myself and Heaven.	N,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was to be taken to the country to be buried there in his own grave; so they carried him away; no one followed him, for all his friends were dead; and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as the hearse moved away with it.	Sa,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little one stretched out her hand towards them, and the match went out.	Su-,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But as soon as she stepped into the cold water, a sudden faintness seized her; she clutched at the air convulsively with her hand, took one step forward, and fell.	N,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out of her little daughter"s hand, and said, "You shall not have one before your brother."	A,A
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The king"s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone else came to ask her to dance, he said, "This lady is dancing with me."	N,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one.	H,H
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then a man took it up to remove it, and one of the bees stung him in the hand, so that he let the flower-pot fall, and it was broken to pieces.	N,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy.	Su-,H
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now he had carved Holger Danske, who stood there erect and proud, with his long beard, holding in one hand his broad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the Danish arms.	N,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"See," cried the youngest, "there is a new one;" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, "There is another swan come; a new one has arrived."	H,H
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered that each brick, when finished, brought him in a small coin, if only a copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one upon another, can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a person knocks, who has a number of these in his hands, whether it be the baker's, the butcher's, or the tailor's, the door flies open, and he can get all he wants.	Su+,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the youth took the plough, and just pressed it with one hand, but his grasp was so strong that the plough went deep into the earth.	N,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he ran after him with the knife still in his hand, crying: "Just one, just one," meaning that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both.	F,Sa
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on.	F,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Oh, how unfortunate," said the landlord, wringing his hands.	Su-,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Each one carried a burning taper in his hand, and one was given to me, as well as to little Anastasia.	N,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It seemed too much for him to bear; and this happened not once, but many times; and at last one day he seized the delicate fingers and the white hand, and kissed it, and looked into her great brown eyes.	H,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And they ran towards each other and took one another's hand, in the great cathedral of nature and poesy, and above them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy spirits surrounded them, singing hallelujahs and rejoicing.	H,H
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah! the fool," answered the devil; "when any one comes and wants to go across he must put the oar in his hand, and the other man will have to ferry and he will be free."	H,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ferry me across first," said the luck-child, "and then I will tell you how you can be set free," and when he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil"s advice: "Next time any one comes, who wants to be ferried over, just put the oar in his hand."	N,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One of the branches of the tree had, however, been broken: mischievous hands must have done this in passing, for the tree now stood in a public thoroughfare.	N,N
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the second girl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to the one who was on the King"s right hand, "Hilloa! hilloa!	N,N

wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The one who stood first in the rank was named the thumb, he was short and thick, and had only one joint in his back, and could therefore make but one bow; but he said that if he were cut off from a man's hand, that man would be unfit for a soldier.

wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, "I never saw any one half so beautiful."	H,H
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with the other took his son out of the horse"s ear, and put him down upon a straw, where he sat as merry as you please.	N,H
wringing one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The child still sat, in the stiffness of death, holding the matches in her hand, one bundle of which was burnt.	N,N

rocking back and forth	[('RELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I can never go back to my father"s house," said he; "they would say I am a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to my kingdom."	N,N
rocking back and forth	[('RELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Instead of returning to the king, however, he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron Hans.	H,N
rocking back and forth	[('RELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Large rocks, covered with moss of various hues, were lying about; the fresh spring water rippled forth with a peculiar sound.	N,N
lips parting	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('ADORATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he kissed her lips; and so they parted.	H,N
feeling like one’s insides are vibrating	[('EXCITEMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The pieces of the money-pig were thrown into the dust-bin, and the next day there stood a new money-pig on the cupboard, but it had not a farthing in its inside yet, and therefore, like the old one, it could not rattle.	N,N
feeling like one’s insides are vibrating	[('EXCITEMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	When he went to one of them he saw inside it a handsome structure like a castle surrounded by farm-buildings, stables and barns, and a quantity of other good things.	N,N
wishing for comfort	[('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"Ah," sighed the woman heavily, "if I had but a child, as red as blood and as white as snow," and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted.	H,H
wishing for comfort	[('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"I have still two wishes left," said he, and comforted himself with that thought.	N,H
wishing for comfort	[('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Sorry as he was to see his wish so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day more beautiful.	Sa,Sa
attempting to keep one’s voice light	[('FEAR', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	When he learnt the wickedness of his daughter he said, "I cannot believe that she has behaved so ill, but the truth will soon come to light," and bade both go into a secret chamber and keep themselves hidden from every one.	D,N
slowly shaking one’s head	[('DISAPPOINTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Let me see him," said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, "It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy."	H,H
slowly shaking one’s head	[('DISAPPOINTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said, "No, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, I might very soon go begging myself.	D,N
slowly shaking one’s head	[('DISAPPOINTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He opened the door slowly, and one of the princesses was sitting there, and had nine dragon"s heads lying upon her lap, and was combing them.	N,N
headache	[('ANGER', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('HATRED', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('NERVOUSNESS', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	But guessing was of very little use; it made his bark ache, and this pain is as bad for a slender fir-tree, as headache is for us.	N,N
nodding rather than speaking	[('EXCITEMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Sometimes he came to one of the windows and looked out; then the little boy nodded to him, and the old man nodded back again, till they became acquainted, and were friends, although they had never spoken to each other; but that was of no consequence.	N,N
hesitating	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	He hesitated, but driven by a mysterious force, he obeyed the voice and went through the iron-door into a large spacious hall, whose ceiling, walls and floor were made of shining polished square stones, on each of which were cut letters which were unknown to him.	N,N
hesitating	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	He had something else to say, which made him hesitate in a strange manner.	N,F
hesitating	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Still Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him--	N,N
hesitating	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Mr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with the hook--hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock.	N,N
hesitating	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And yet, when the fire was extinguished, and the goblin again began to reflect, he hesitated, and said at last, "I must divide myself between the two; I cannot quite give up the huckster, because of the jam."	N,N
knees going weak	[('AMAZEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and said:	F,F
knees going weak	[('AMAZEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And as she sung, the shadows grew paler and paler; the blood in the emperor's veins flowed more rapidly, and gave life to his weak limbs; and even Death himself listened, and said, "Go on, little nightingale, go on."	N,N
knees going weak	[('AMAZEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then he fell on his knees before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she went her way.	F,Sa
knees going weak	[('AMAZEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	My sister Anastasia sat on the knee of one of them; and when they were gone, she had not three, but two silver coins in her hair- one had disappeared.	N,N
knees going weak	[('AMAZEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Alas!" said the dog, "my master was going to knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to earn my livelihood?"	Sa,Sa
knees going weak	[('AMAZEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go, it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.	N,N
knees going weak	[('AMAZEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then said he, "Father, I see well that with you I shall never have food enough; if you will get me an iron staff which is strong, and which I cannot break against my knees, I will go out into the world."	N,N
staring down at one’s hands or feet	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.	H,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round.	A,A
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime had come, the witch"s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall.	F,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	On reaching the entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every step she took.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"We must think of something else," said the king; "keep your shoes on when you go to bed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it."	F,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain, and with these two things go back by the same way.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After hearing his answers, the old man took him home to a small house close by, in a back street.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the tree and sang--	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had carried his master through fire and smoke in the battle-field, with the bullets whistling round him; he had kicked and bitten, and taken part in the fight, when the enemy advanced; and, with his master on his back, he had dashed over the fallen foe, and saved the golden crown and the Emperor's life, which was of more value than the brightest gold.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It's a difficult step to take, and yet it must be taken.	F,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she took off the hinges, and said, "Frederick told me to lock the door, but surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me."	Su-,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing it.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The boy can stay here and take care of the linen, and I'll come back and finish the washing; it is but a trifle."	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise," "Well thrown," said the tailor, "but after all the stone came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come back at all," and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air.	H,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Christina was taken back to her father's house on the heath, and Ib remained in the farm-house on the borders of the wood, near the great land ridge.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he took his meal on his back, went home, and told the bailiff that he had done what he had been told to do, and would now have the reward agreed on.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The giant, however, had scarcely taken two steps with his long legs before he was in the furrow.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"No, I don"t know," replied the boy, "but someone was standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he would neither gave an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel, and threw him downstairs.	Su-,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Take back your horse and your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again."	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Out of the thicket stepped a tall old woman, her face quite brown, and her hair of a deep shining black; the whites of her eyes glittered like a Moor's; on her back she carried a bundle, and in her hand a knotted stick.	Su-,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Now that will do," said the giant, "thou art perfect," and took him back to the field from whence he had brought him.	H,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him nothing more to eat, and said, "I want you no longer, so take yourself off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are stronger than a lion."	N,D
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But Tom, hearing of the bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father"s coat to his shoulder and whispered in his ear, "Take the money, father, and let them have me; I"ll soon come back to you."	H,H
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Thereupon the Virgin Mary appeared to her in the night when she lay in her bed alone, and said, "If thou wilt tell the truth and confess that thou didst unlock the forbidden door, I will open thy mouth and give thee back thy speech, but if thou perseverest in thy sin, and deniest obstinately, I will take thy new-born child away with me."	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he took it into his head to measure how many steps he would have to go through the roads and cross-roads that are on the leaf of a linden-tree.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, "I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will soon have a daughter."	H,H
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he went back to the roof and sang:	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they were all terrified, and the King took the bird, the fisherman and the three children back with him to the castle, and ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife out again.	F,F
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She sprang to the door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and brought her back and said, "Fear me not!	F,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now do you lie down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you that they will take care of you as long as you live."	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the giant thought, "We must do better than that," took him back again, and suckled him two years longer.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the head-servant went to the loft, and put two bushels in his right pocket, and two in his left, and took four in a wallet, half on his back, and half on his breast, and thus laden went to the haunted mill.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again the next day.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	However, as he was afraid of this great man, he left go of the plough, stepped back and stood at one side of the piece of land.	F,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She had on each hand five fingers, and anything so conceited as these five fingers I have never seen; and yet they were only employed to take me out of the box and to put me back again."	H,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah!" replied the horse, "justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so."	Sa,Sa
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when he came before the enemy, there was a battle, and great danger, and it rained shot until his comrades fell on all sides, and when the leader also was killed, those left were about to take flight, but the youth stepped forth, spoke boldly to them, and cried, "We will not let our fatherland be ruined!"	N,A
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then said the head-servant to the bailiff"s wife, "If he does not come back, you must take the other blow."	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.	H,H
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the old woman took him up on her back and carried him through it, and he sought for a long time, but could not find his father.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising to come again the next night.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Every evening I have permission to take home to my poor sick mother the scraps from the table; she lives down by the sea-shore, and as I come back I feel tired, and I sit down in the wood to rest, and listen to the nightingale's song.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There"s never a plank, or bridge in sight, Take us across on thy back so white."	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When it came to her turn to sing, she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she could not refuse.	Sa,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At length, when it was quite dark, Clever Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about her, and the bells rang at each step which she took.	F,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.	A,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pick up the wand again from the threshold and take it with you, and when you again pass by the dog, strike him in the face with it, but be sure that you hit him, and then just come back here to me."	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.	A,A
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, "My Lord Judge, grant me one last request."	F,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But as soon as she stepped into the cold water, a sudden faintness seized her; she clutched at the air convulsively with her hand, took one step forward, and fell.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She took a few steps, such as a crawling animal may take, and soon found herself on a road beside which people dwelt; but there were flower gardens as well as kitchen gardens.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They knew each other: the boy was the one who had not been able to go with them because he had to take the coat and boots back to his landlord's son.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then Mother Holle said, "I am pleased that you should want to go back to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I will take you home myself."	H,H
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As soon as it was night, and the shop closed, and every one in bed except the student, the goblin stepped softly into the bedroom where the huckster's wife slept, and took away her tongue, which of course, she did not then want.	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When a year had gone by the Queen again bore a son, and in the night the Virgin Mary again came to her, and said, "If thou wilt confess that thou openedst the forbidden door, I will give thee thy child back and untie thy tongue; but if you continuest in sin and deniest it, I will take away with me this new child also."	N,N
taking a step back	[('AMAZEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Meantime the master looked to see what the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps.	N,N
glancing at one’s watch	[('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She raised herself a little, and glanced at the door of the room where all her flowers and playthings lay; it was partly open, and as she listened, it seemed as if some one in the room was playing the piano, but softly and more prettily than she had ever before heard it.	H,N
glancing at one’s watch	[('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He remembered a story told of her, that on one occasion, when she was carrying a basket full of wine and provisions, her husband, who had watched her footsteps, stepped forward and asked her angrily what she carried in her basket, whereupon, with fear and trembling, she answered, "Roses, which I have plucked from the garden."	N,F
glancing at one’s watch	[('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the next night one of the old ladies of the court was set to watch by the princess's bed, to discover whether it really was a dream, or what else it might be.	N,N
glancing at one’s watch	[('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Once on a time when he was riding forth from his castle with his huntsmen, three girls were watching their cows upon the mountain, and when they saw the King with all his followers, the eldest girl pointed to him, and called to the two other girls, "If I do not get that one, I will have none."	N,N
glancing at one’s watch	[('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At night, all the boxes were placed against the doors, and one of the travellers watched while the others slept.	N,N
glancing at one’s watch	[('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the coffin was set among the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched.	Sa,N
glancing at one’s watch	[('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The Lord had commanded him to let no one in during his absence, so Peter stood by the door and kept watch.	N,N
glancing at one’s watch	[('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Umbrellas, sticks, and hats swung in the net before him, and almost obstructed the prospect, which was really very imposing; and as he glanced at it, his memory recalled the words of one poet at least, who has sung of Switzerland, and whose poems have not yet been printed:-	N,N
glancing at one’s watch	[('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Tommy Brock watched him with one eye, through the window.	N,N
glancing at one’s watch	[('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over the fire chatting together, he said to her, "I should like to sit up and watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for me."	N,N
glancing at one’s watch	[('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to watch what the little elves would do.	H,H
glancing at one’s watch	[('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.	N,N
a silent look	[('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He only looked at her and they both remained silent.	N,N
being unable to think or talk about anything else	[('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	If we don't do anything else, we can walk about with you everywhere, and we think that is the best thing we can do."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Sit fast, when you dance," said he, addressing the shoes, and slapping the soles with his hand.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"You are the right sort to dance with, certainly," said she, turning her back upon him.	D,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing still.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, "I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask."	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"But flowers cannot dance?" cried little Ida.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	His step is a dance!	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, "I have travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was dancing upon one leg, and singing:	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Where do the beautiful flowers dance?" asked little Ida.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When the dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	ANNE LISBETH was a beautiful young woman, with a red and white complexion, glittering white teeth, and clear soft eyes; and her footstep was light in the dance, but her mind was lighter still.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But the old goblin danced about the room with his young bride, and exchanged boots with her, which is more fashionable than exchanging rings.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"So," said the bear; "fiddling is a thing I should like to understand too, that I might dance whenever I had a fancy.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Will you dance with me?" said the rough doll.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"No," said he, "I won"t dance with a pussy cat.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the king"s son lost sight of her, and could not find out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said to him, "The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I think she must have sprung into the pear-tree."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And the little creature danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing in the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges, wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The faster he played, the more violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.	A,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They slept in twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody could find out how it happened, or where they had been.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and singing--	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	In the same courtyard two of the merry children were playing who had danced round the tree at Christmas, and had been so happy.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	He danced about and pinched his brother, singing--	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	We should suit so well; you spring, and I dance.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the door of the room opened, and a number of beautiful flowers danced in.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	There was a golden treasure in his bosom, the power of sound; it burst forth on his violin as if the instrument had been a complete organ, and as if all the elves of a midsummer night were dancing across the strings.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	After work, came the recreations, dancing and playing in the greenwood, and the "harvest homes."	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance; and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door of his chamber was left open.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed mightily delighted.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"We'll dance the bung out of the cask at carnival time," said he; "I'll prepare a merry tune for you and for myself too.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then their anxieties are dispelled; and at even they join in the dance at the feast given in the great hall at Borglum.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Ashputtel"s two sisters were asked to come; so they called her up, and said, "Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king"s feast."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The carnival rod hopped about among the flowers on its three red stilted feet, and stamped quite loud when it danced the Mazurka; the flowers could not perform this dance, they were too light to stamp in that manner.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"'Now, let us have a dance,' said the fire-tongs; and then how they danced and stuck up one leg in the air.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She gathered herself up, and hastened to the churchyard; but black crosses and black ravens danced before her eyes, and she could not distinguish one from the other.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Where do my twelve daughters dance at night?" he answered, "With twelve princes in a castle under ground."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"You, Ashputtel!" said she; "you who have nothing to wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to the ball?	D,D
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king"s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her.	F,F
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Now all the flowers are certainly dancing in there," she thought, "oh how much I should like to see them," but she did not dare move for fear of disturbing her father and mother.	H,F
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, "I never saw any one half so beautiful."	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They were even lighter and more delicate than the flowers from which they were born; and as the flames were extinguished, and nothing remained of the paper but black ashes, these little beings danced upon it; and whenever they touched it, bright red sparks appeared.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	It was not very large, and the floor was of lime; but when he danced with his bride on the lime-covered floor, it was to him white and shining, and from every stone in the wall flowers seemed to spring forth and decorate the room as with the richest tapestry.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	After the dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the soup.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The wolf is dead!" and danced for joy round about the well with their mother.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Do you remember," said the canary, "the pretty maidens who used to dance in the tents that were spread out beneath the sweet blossoms?	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But when she wanted to go to the right, the shoes danced to the left, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danced down the room, down the stairs through the street, and out through the gates of the town.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	He has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on top of the cupboard!	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the pennies hopped and danced about in the most amusing manner.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She dropped Pigling's hand and commenced to dance, singing-- presently.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The shoes bore her away over thorns and stumps till she was all torn and bleeding; she danced away over the heath to a lonely little house.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	I cannot come in, for I must dance."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She danced and was obliged to go on dancing over field and meadow, in rain and sunshine, by night and by day- but by night it was most horrible.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	It was no use, he might make himself great and tall, or remain a little wax doll with a large black hat; still he must dance.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The people came from the town, and walked upon it, and they say there were dancing and skating upon it, I believe, and a great feasting.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air.	A,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then they rose up and opened their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager to begin dancing.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	So whilst he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And so, on every summer day the dance was repeated, the same questions asked, and the same answers given.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	He lifted her into the carriage, but her feet continued to dance, so that she kicked the good old lady violently.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"There is something going on within there," said the other lizard; "they propped up the top of the hill with four red posts, till cock-crow this morning, so that it is thoroughly aired, and the elfin girls have learnt new dances; there is something."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The feast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you and I had been of the party.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And as she danced past the open church door she saw an angel there in long white robes, with wings reaching from his shoulders down to the earth; his face was stern and grave, and in his hand he held a broad shining sword.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She lay awake a long time after she was in bed, thinking how pretty it must be to see all the beautiful flowers dancing in the king's garden.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Dance you shall, from door to door, and where proud and wicked children live you shall knock, so that they may hear you and fear you!	D,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But her mother said, "It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame": and off she went with her two daughters to the ball.	D,D
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the elfin girls had to dance, first in the usual way, and then with stamping feet, which they performed very well; then followed the artistic and solo dance.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And she went quickly up to the church-door; but when she came there, the red shoes were dancing before her, and she was frightened, and turned back.	F,F
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And they were standing before the magnificently illuminated gate; the broad steps were adorned with carpets and flowers, and dance music was sounding through the festive halls.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	All the will-o'-the-wisps are ordered to be there to hold a torch dance, as it is called.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then she seated herself on the edge of the drawer, and thought that perhaps one of the flowers would ask her to dance; but none of them came.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Within there were songs and dancing; King Waldemar and the young gayly-dressed ladies of the court were dancing together.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	At the second note the hangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and all the people who had followed to look on.	A,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other!	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	His mighty summits was crowned with spreading fresh green foliage; the sunbeams played among the leaves and branches, and the air was full of fragrance from herb and blossom; painted butterflies chased each other; the summer flies danced around him, as if the world had been created merely for them to dance and be merry in.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The children then danced about with their pretty toys, and no one noticed the tree, except the children's maid who came and peeped among the branches to see if an apple or a fig had been forgotten.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	No one could tell where the dance begun, or where it ended, nor indeed which were legs and which were arms, for they were all flying about together, like the shavings in a saw-pit!	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But the mother said, "No, no! you slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go."	A,A
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The ladies danced and clapped their hands for joy.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf met him, and asked him what made him so merry.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They danced on till three o"clock in the morning, and then all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But just as Karen was lifting up her foot to get in too, the old soldier said: "Dear me, what pretty dancing shoes!" and Karen could not help it, she was obliged to dance a few steps; and when she had once begun, her legs continued to dance.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Not a singing bird was ever heard there, neither did men dance to the sound of the pipe.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And so she went boldly on; but she had not got farther than the churchyard gate when she saw the red shoes dancing along before her.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced to dance, for it was a magical dance.	A,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	There they all landed, and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The flowers were dancing gracefully on the floor, making turns and holding each other by their long green leaves as they swung round.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They led her into the middle of the room, where the moon shone, and danced with her, while all the other flowers formed a circle round them.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When the bear heard the music, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a while, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little tailor, "Hark you, is the fiddle heavy?"	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They dance on the green rampart, just on the place where, according to the old story, the ground always sank in, and where a sportive, frolicsome child had been lured by means of flowers, toys and sweetmeats into an open grave ready dug for it, and which was afterwards closed over the child; and from that moment, the old story says, the ground gave way no longer, the mound remained firm and fast, and was quickly covered with the green turf.	F,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the former one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the king"s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to dance, he said, "This lady is /my/ partner, sir."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And when she came in it to the ball, everyone wondered at her beauty: but the king"s son, who was waiting for her, took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to dance, he said as before, "This lady is dancing with me."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The king"s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone else came to ask her to dance, he said, "This lady is dancing with me."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then she saw a large purple crocus jump into the middle of the table where the playthings stood, go up to the doll's bedstead and draw back the curtains; there lay the sick flowers, but they got up directly, and nodded to the others as a sign that they wished to dance with them.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But the king"s son soon fell asleep; and when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced out at the door, and away over the green.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Waltzes and Styrian dances are given, and Danish popular songs, and melodies of foreign lands in these modern times.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But she did not hear what the angel answered, for the shoes carried her through the gate into the fields, along highways and byways, and unceasingly she had to dance.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The children danced round the grave, and the eldest of the boys among them, a practical youngster of seven years, made the proposition that there should be an exhibition of Puggie's burial-place for all who lived in the lane; the price of admission was to be a trouser button, for every boy would be sure to have one, and each might also give one for a little girl.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"I hardly know where I am going, or what I had better do," said the soldier; "but I think I should like very well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time I might be a king."	N,Sa
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The elfin maidens we're already dancing on the elf hill, and they danced in shawls woven from moonshine and mist, which look very pretty to those who like such things.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The blue violets represent little naval cadets, and dance with hyacinths and crocuses which they call young ladies.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Nutkin danced up and down like a SUNBEAM; but still Old Brown said nothing at all.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She danced round the church corner, for she could not stop; the coachman had to run after her and seize her.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"You are not kind at all," said Ida; "and yet they all danced with you."	D,A
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven, with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague, the ugly heavy stone.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And all the good people they danced and they sung, And feasted and frolick"d I can"t tell how long.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She looked at the red shoes, saying to herself that there was no sin in doing that; she put the red shoes on, thinking there was no harm in that either; and then she went to the ball; and commenced to dance.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.	N,Su+
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to go home: and the king"s son said, "I shall go and take care of you to your home"; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither.	N,Su-
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She danced, and was obliged to dance, far out into the dark wood.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Mad with pain, he tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them far away, and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat.	A,A
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then came many more flowers: blue violets, purple heart's-ease, daisies, and lilies of the valley, and they all danced together, and kissed each other.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the men and maidens danced, and sung in a circle round the blazing pile.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The elder-tree smelt strongly, and the setting sun illuminated the faces of the two old people, so that they looked quite rosy; the youngest of the grandchildren danced round them, and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening, for they were to have hot potatoes; and the elder mother nodded in the tree and cried 'Hooray' with the others."	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They came to the river, they came to the bridge--they crossed it hand in hand--then over the hills and far away she danced with Pigling Bland!	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But it was the old soldier with the red beard; he sat there nodding his head and said: "Dear me, what pretty dancing shoes!"	Su+,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"But," said little Ida, "is there no one there to hurt the flowers for dancing in the king's castle?"	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	One morning she danced past a door that she knew well; they were singing a psalm inside, and a coffin was being carried out covered with flowers.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	He was now a golden top, and whirled and danced about till he hummed quite loud, and was something worth looking at; but one day he leaped too high, and then he, also, was gone.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When they had dined, the table was carried away, and the cat said, "Now, Hans, come and dance with me."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but he did not come up to the musician"s price for some time, and he danced him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse, and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow.	F,Sa
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The fire crackled and danced, and something sizz-z-zled!	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She danced, and was obliged to go on dancing through the dark night.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Her delicate fingers danced over the keys, and made them ring into Peter's heart.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She danced out into the open churchyard; but the dead there did not dance.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	For a moment the little ones stood silent with astonishment, and then they shouted for joy, till the room rang, and they danced merrily round the tree, while one present after another was taken from it.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	During the whole day he enjoyed himself in the warm sunshine, flew from flower to flower, and danced on the wings of the flying butterflies.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Can they do anything more than dance and throw about their legs, and make a whirlwind?"	D,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The flowers did hang their heads, because they had been dancing all night, and were very tired, and most likely they were ill.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The carnival rod went on dancing, and the lawyer was obliged to dance also.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	You know she always dances when she hears music and singing of any sort; so she began to dance immediately, although she ought not to have done so, but she could not get into the right time because the tune was so slow; so she stood first on one leg and then on the other, and bent her head very low, but it would not suit the music.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Dance you shall," said he, "dance in your red shoes till you are pale and cold, till your skin shrivels up and you are a skeleton!	D,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Sometimes the roller and the bucket danced in the air, splashing the water all over the court.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought: "Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please her too.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Dance you shall, dance- !"	D,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	In the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night; and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home.	N,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Today I"ll brew, tomorrow bake; Merrily I"ll dance and sing, For next day will a stranger bring.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then she ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in, looking like a king"s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And then she confessed all her sin, and the executioner struck off her feet with the red shoes; but the shoes danced away with the little feet across the field into the deep forest.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	At first the thing was merry and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties, till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him the hundred florins.	F,Sa
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then he went his way, and in the evening came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty, and poor.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	What do they do that for," she asked, of the student who sat on the sofa; she liked him very much, he could tell the most amusing stories, and cut out the prettiest pictures; hearts, and ladies dancing, castles with doors that opened, as well as flowers; he was a delightful student.	N,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	He described everything so clearly, that those who listened could see it all; they could see the saw-mills going, the men-servants and the maidens singing songs, and dancing a rattling dance,- when all at once the old goblin gave the old elfin maiden a kiss, such a tremendous kiss, and yet they were almost strangers to each other.	N,N
turning away	[('SADNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('GUILT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('SCORN', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	She sprang up and wanted to run away, but whithersoever she turned herself, she was continually held back by thick hedges of thorns through which she could not break.

backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round.

backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So Tuk ran across quickly, and helped her, but when he came back into the room it was quite dark, and there was not a word said about a light, so he was obliged to go to bed on his little truckle bedstead, and there he lay and thought of his geography lesson, and of Zealand, and of all the master had told him.

backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One evening the student came into the shop through the back door to buy candles and cheese for himself, he had no one to send, and therefore he came himself; he obtained what he wished, and then the huckster and his wife nodded good evening to him, and she was a woman who could do more than merely nod, for she had usually plenty to say for herself.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he tied up all his money in her apron. and slung it on his back like a bundle, put the tinderbox in his pocket, and walked off to the nearest town.	N,N

backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In fact, this memory of the soul is a fearful thing; every sin, every sinful thought it can bring back, and we may well ask how we are to give account of "every idle word" that may have been whispered in the heart or uttered with the lips.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The King heard all this, and when he had come back from the chase, he caused the three girls to be brought to him, and asked them what they had said yesterday on the mountain.	N,N

backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The one who stood first in the rank was named the thumb, he was short and thick, and had only one joint in his back, and could therefore make but one bow; but he said that if he were cut off from a man's hand, that man would be unfit for a soldier.	N,N

backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house, and cried out as before:	F,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Your dirty daughter"s come back to you."	D,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing it.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she became terrified, and turned back and repented right heartily of her sin.	F,F
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	First comes the band of sparrows: they pipe at every trifle in the streets and lanes, in the nests and the houses; they have stories to tell about the front buildings and the back buildings.	N,N

backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In a large party it is very disagreeable to find a button giving way, with no studs at hand to fall back upon; but it is worse still in a large company to be conscious that your wife and mother-in-law are talking nonsense, and that you cannot depend upon yourself to produce a little ready wit to carry off the stupidity of the whole affair.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then said the head-servant to the bailiff"s wife, "If he does not come back, you must take the other blow."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The ass placed himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog"s shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat"s head.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The other paid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time.	A,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the old man came back with a pleasant face; and brought with him beautiful preserved fruits, as well as apples and nuts; and the little boy thought no more of the tin soldier.	H,H
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door.	N,N

backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Yes," said Little Claus; "I am going to the town with my old grandmother; she is sitting at the back of the wagon, but I cannot bring her into the room.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The boy can stay here and take care of the linen, and I'll come back and finish the washing; it is but a trifle."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was lying on his back with his mouth open, grinning from ear to ear.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the huntsman pitied them, and told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he gave them some of the good salad to eat.	Sa,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me," answered Hansel.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She had wished to keep back a soul from its immortal flight; she had forgotten her duties towards the living who were left her.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah," said he quite roughly and surlily, "you may just go, then; I shall be back again before any of you."	A,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: "I must go into the cellar myself and see where Elsie is."	A,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The maiden found everything exactly as the old woman had said, and on her way back she found her two brothers who had sought each other over half the world.	Su+,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their holes.	F,F
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun.	H,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he went back to the roof and sang:	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he took his meal on his back, went home, and told the bailiff that he had done what he had been told to do, and would now have the reward agreed on.	N,N

backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He fished up the dead body, and by the help of the three snake-leaves which he carried about with him, and laid on the eyes and mouth, he fortunately brought the young King back to life.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the Lord and master came back again with his heavenly companions, he did not see the tailor behind the door, but when he seated himself on his chair the footstool was missing.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery.	F,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Her sister Joanna was bright and slender as a lily; she had a tall and lofty carriage and figure, though, like her mother, rather stiff in back.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he shot his arrow at the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and ran into the wood.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Back again! back again! look to the shoe!	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They all asked what he desired, so he said he wished to get above ground back to daylight, on which they seized him by every hair that grew on his head, and thus they flew with him onto the earth again.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him back by the sleeve, and said: "No, you must wait until the lord and lady Queen have gone away again."	A,A
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had carried his master through fire and smoke in the battle-field, with the bullets whistling round him; he had kicked and bitten, and taken part in the fight, when the enemy advanced; and, with his master on his back, he had dashed over the fallen foe, and saved the golden crown and the Emperor's life, which was of more value than the brightest gold.

backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they came back again said, "In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep."	Su+,Su+

backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream; and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and managed to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners, who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water and were all carried away by the stream and drowned.	Sa,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He told it me himself, and he hadn't "a rogue on his back," as mother used to tell me he had when he wanted to make me believe something outrageous, for now he looked quite trustworthy.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The next morning his back was very sore, which was all he gained by the goloshes of Fortune.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At this sight she was sadly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her seat.	Su+,D
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter.	F,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The wolf ran with the child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master and mistress.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Her thoughts were like a confused, tangled skein; only one thread, only one thought was clear to her, namely that she must carry the spectre of the sea-shore to the churchyard, and dig a grave for him there; that by so doing she might win back her soul.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But no sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin"s back, and went off carrying the prince away with her.	N,Su-
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now many went out into the wood for the sake of this splendid berth; but only one of them came back with some sort of explanation.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the Lord turned his back on the rich man, and went across to the small house and knocked.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it and said: "Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After a time a second snake crept out of the hole, and when it saw the other lying dead and cut in pieces, it went back, but soon came again with three green leaves in its mouth.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Thou art with me, dear wife," he answered, and told her how everything had happened, and how he had brought her back again to life.	H,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	My sister will suppose he is dead; for he cannot come back, and she will not dare to question me about him."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He turned back in the full conviction that he must be ill.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the evening, when the sister was tired, and had said her prayer, she laid her head upon the roebuck"s back: that was her pillow, and she slept softly on it.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Yes; as you see, I can even venture under the rays of the lamp, in front of the picture of the Madonna, but I may not enter the church; still from without, and while you are upon my back, I may look in through the open door.	Sa,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Back again! back again! look to the shoe!	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Out of the thicket stepped a tall old woman, her face quite brown, and her hair of a deep shining black; the whites of her eyes glittered like a Moor's; on her back she carried a bundle, and in her hand a knotted stick.	Su-,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He came round the back of the fir- tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter.	N,Su-
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	This really did vex him, and before he was aware, he said, "I just wish she was sitting there on this saddle, and could not get off it, instead of my having to drag it along on my back."	N,A
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She called out: "Good morning," but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed his locks for him finely.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The saddle hurt his back, and he had not yet any idea what to wish for.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when the King came back, they told him that the Queen had once more given birth to a dog, and he again said, "What God does, is well done."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pick up the wand again from the threshold and take it with you, and when you again pass by the dog, strike him in the face with it, but be sure that you hit him, and then just come back here to me."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He beat the people with his bat, which made a great clattering without hurting them, and the people would crowd together and fall back, only to advance again the next moment.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Now he is gone, and will soon be forgotten," thought the wicked brother; "he will never come back again.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	By the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when she had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found nobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her eyes open.	Su+,Su-
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They must be followed instantly to get them back again."	F,F
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. Tod turned his back towards the bed, and undid the window.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Away went the horse full gallop; and before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his back by the road-side.	Su-,Su-
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a journey; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should bring back for her.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the prince thought to himself, "I cannot go home to my father without my brothers"; so he said, "My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who set out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?"	N,Sa
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Of course I know them," replied the yard-dog; "she has stroked my back many times, and he has given me a bone of meat.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Yes, but seat thyself at the back of the carriage, for in the front my little horses could not drag thee."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him.	N,H
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pigling squealed; then ran back frantically, hoping to overtake Alexander and the policeman.	Su+,H
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. Piperson hurried out with the hamper, enjoining Pigling to shut the door behind him and not meddle with nought; or "I'll come back and skin ye!" said Mr. Piperson.	A,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might.	F,F
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	How much came back to his remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native town!	Sa,Sa
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she was coming in at the front door.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He told me that if I would now comply with his wish, it was an easy thing for him to put everything back in its former state, as he had nothing to do but open the vessels, and everything would return once more to its natural form.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he fell back again.	H,H
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Tiny said nothing; but when the two others had turned their backs on the bird, she stooped down and stroked aside the soft feathers which covered the head, and kissed the closed eyelids.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	No one thanked him for the offer, and I saw the ruined old gentleman lift his head, and throw it back more proudly than ever.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:	F,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old world close to her mother"s house.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought: "One of the wings is burning!	N,Su-
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go, it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The word had not yet been given to fall back, though they might have done so, and perhaps there would have been much sense in it; and now at last the word "Retire" was given; but our little drummer beat "Forward! march!" for he had understood the command thus, and the soldiers obeyed the sound of the drum.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the dog ran back with the princess; but in the morning, while at breakfast with the king and queen, she told them what a singular dream she had had during the night, of a dog and a soldier, that she had ridden on the dog's back, and been kissed by the soldier.	Su+,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Away he went through the already-deserted streets, and soon came to the Metal Pig; he stooped down and kissed its shining nose, and then seated himself on its back.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!"	Su-,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pig-wig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket; "Sing something," she demanded.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But when they had broken open the door they found no one within; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as she always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little lamp was burning in the chimney.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, "I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will soon have a daughter."	H,H
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then little Ida crept back into her bed again, and dreamt of all she had seen.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She had been sitting in her arm-chair, telling us a long, beautiful tale; and when it was finished, she said she was tired, and leaned her head back to sleep awhile.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Now have we revenged the dead," said they, and flew back into the white bells of the jasmine flowers.	H,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to the table and ate.	H,H
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.	Sa,Sa
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Thanks to yourself also," replied the Metal Pig; "I have helped you and you have helped me, for it is only when I have an innocent child on my back that I receive the power to run.	H,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	You can sit on my back, and fasten yourself on with your sash.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key.	Sa,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They rode back and announced this to the king.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Perhaps he had been long laid in the grave, and would never come back to his home, to rule where his mother then ruled.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he wanted.	H,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband, "Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after the thieves."	H,H
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he went down stairs again into the huckster's shop, and it was a good thing he got back when he did, for the cask had almost worn out the lady's tongue; he had given a description of all that he contained on one side, and was just about to turn himself over to the other side to describe what was there, when the goblin entered and restored the tongue to the lady.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone for along time; then as no one would come back he thought: "They must be waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Benjamin was on his back scratching upwards.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he would rise from his bed, creep down the ladder- for it could scarcely be called a flight of stairs- and when he reached the fire-pan not a spark could be seen; so he had just to go back again to bed.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	During the night, the dog came again and carried the princess on his back, and ran with her to the soldier, who loved her very much, and wished that he had been a prince, so that he might have her for a wife.	N,H
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bird, delighted with its liberty, rose, flew away and did not come back.	H,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His head ached, his back was stiff, and the blood had ceased to circulate, so that his feet were swelled and pinched by his boots.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they were all terrified, and the King took the bird, the fisherman and the three children back with him to the castle, and ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife out again.	F,F
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had his knapsack on his back, and a sword at his side; he had been to the wars, and was now returning home.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As he was miserly by nature, he did not like to leave the harness lying there; so he cut it off, and put it on his back; and now he had to go on foot.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was not long before the Virgin Mary came back from her journey.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	By the road she meant the river, for she could not travel any other way; but I knew the winding of the river, and how it bends, sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left, and it seemed a long way, so I chose a shorter one; and, by coming up to the land, and then driving across the fields back again to the river, I shall save half a mile, and get all my cattle more quickly."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At the back, large palm-trees were growing; and the sunlight made the leaves- look quite glossy; and beneath them what a profusion of luxuriant green, and of flowers red like flame, yellow as amber, or white as new-fallen snow!	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The tom cat, whom the mistress called, "My little son," was a great favorite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the fox seated himself at the back, and after that the wolf, the bear, the stag, the lion, and all the beasts of the forest did the same.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She sprang to the door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and brought her back and said, "Fear me not!	F,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It must be done, for very shame; you are sure to be asked when you come back if you have seen everything, and will most likely be told that you've omitted to see what was best worth seeing of all.	D,D
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he came back after removing the coal scuttle, Tommy Brock was lying a little more sideways; but he seemed even sounder asleep.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And he had to sit out in the rain in the worst weather, and get wet to the skin, and let the cold wind dry the clothes on his back afterwards.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very comfortable.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now do you lie down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you that they will take care of you as long as you live."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"That you shall know," answered he; "only wait until I come back."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Within four-and-twenty hours Anthony was back again to Eisenach, though the horse that he rode was entirely ruined.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little boy still sat astride on its back, when he felt something pulling at his clothes.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when they came back into the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey frock.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the giant thought, "We must do better than that," took him back again, and suckled him two years longer.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Did not you ask it for anything?" said the wife, "we live very wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug little cottage."	D,A
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was found at the soldier"s, and the soldier himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back, and thrown into prison.	F,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Not yet, Pig-wig, he will look back."	F,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	This made such a great noise that the woman came out, and when she saw the wolf she called the people, who hurried there, and beat him as long as their sticks would hold together, till with two lame legs, and howling loudly, he got back to the fox in the forest.	A,Sa
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he jumped back into the water.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Each of them is like a closed book, with the back uppermost, on which we can read the title of what the book contains, but nothing more.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair, Linger not in this murderers" lair."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The servant ran after his master and told him what had happened, but would not leave his saddle behind him, and ran back to fetch it.	Su-,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Now that will do," said the giant, "thou art perfect," and took him back to the field from whence he had brought him.	H,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"You shall know that," answered he; "only wait until I come back."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Chairs handsomely carved, with elbows on each side, and with very high backs, stood in the room, and as they creaked they seemed to say, "Sit down.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they went back to the meadow together, but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone.	F,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I cannot go back.	F,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the head-servant went to the loft, and put two bushels in his right pocket, and two in his left, and took four in a wallet, half on his back, and half on his breast, and thus laden went to the haunted mill.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the king"s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever brought her back to him should have her for a wife.	Su-,Sa
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	However, as he was afraid of this great man, he left go of the plough, stepped back and stood at one side of the piece of land.	F,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Late in the autumn, when the days were short, and the mist sprinkled cold drops on the berries and the leafless branches, I came back in fresh spirits, rushed through the air, swept the sky clear, and snapped off the dry twigs, which is certainly no great labor to do, yet it must be done.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the cock drew the carriage himself, but when he got it over and reached the other shore with the dead hen, and was about to draw over the others who were sitting behind as well, there were too many of them, the carriage ran back, and they all fell into the water together, and were drowned.	Su-,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then her voice came back to her, and she cried out loudly, "Yes, Mary, I did it;" and straight-way rain fell from the sky and extinguished the flames of fire, and a light broke forth above her, and the Virgin Mary descended with the two little sons by her side, and the new-born daughter in her arms.	F,F
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The old box that lies yonder may be the back stairs; and we'll lay the flooring on top of it.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They went back to the front of the house, and tried in every way to move the bolt of the kitchen window.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The first leisure moment during the next day, the boy got a pencil, and on the back of one of the other drawings he attempted to copy the drawing of the Metal Pig, and he succeeded.	H,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then I bury them, as it were; there they lie, dead and powerless, till they come back new and better characters.	Su-,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he crept into a large sack, which had been lying across the back of one of the oxen.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair, Linger not in this murderers" lair."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She had on each hand five fingers, and anything so conceited as these five fingers I have never seen; and yet they were only employed to take me out of the box and to put me back again."	H,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back.	H,H
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah!" replied the horse, "justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so."	Sa,Sa
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and green.	Sa,Sa
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now, though it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the water.	F,Sa
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Her portrait, which had been bought at the picture dealer's, went back again to his shop, and there it remained, for no one seemed to know her, or to care for the old picture.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She called the girl before her, and asked to have the keys of heaven back.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.	H,H
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They are called Pyramids, and are older than a stork could imagine; and in that country, there is a river that overflows its banks, and then goes back, leaving nothing but mire; there we can walk about, and eat frogs in abundance."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Suppose I were to go back now and say how ill I feel, I fear it would look so ridiculous, and it is not very likely that I should find any one up."	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As, however, he could not bring the stool back again, he slipped quietly out of the chair, seated himself in his place behind the door, and behaved as if he had never stirred from the spot.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the dwarf held them back, and said, "Let the pretty insects enjoy themselves, I cannot let you burn them."	N,D
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the old woman took him up on her back and carried him through it, and he sought for a long time, but could not find his father.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Sometimes he came to one of the windows and looked out; then the little boy nodded to him, and the old man nodded back again, till they became acquainted, and were friends, although they had never spoken to each other; but that was of no consequence.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: "Thank heaven, you are back again!	F,F
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened to him.	N,N
backing up	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	On this the huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form of the cook, in the which he stood immediately, with his white apron, and his knife by his side.	N,N

poor coloring dark circles under the eyes	[('ANGUISH', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The bright color has been changed by age to dark green; but clear, fresh water pours from the snout, which shines as if it had been polished, and so indeed it has, for hundreds of poor people and children seize it in their hands as they place their mouths close to the mouth of the animal, to drink.

head cocked to the side	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All the ducks lying quietly on the water or standing on their heads in it- for they could do that- at once swarm to the sides; the traces of their feet were seen in the wet earth, and their cackling was heard far and wide.	N,N

head cocked to the side	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the middle of the floor lay a dead swallow, his beautiful wings pulled close to his sides, his feet and his head drawn up under his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of the cold.	Sa,N

placing a hand against the breastbone	[('DENIAL', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered that each brick, when finished, brought him in a small coin, if only a copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one upon another, can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a person knocks, who has a number of these in his hands, whether it be the baker's, the butcher's, or the tailor's, the door flies open, and he can get all he wants.

needing to leave the room	[('AMUSEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But they dragged him out of the room and up stairs to the garret, and threw him on the floor, in a dark corner, where no daylight shone, and there they left him.	N,N

hair hanging in face hiding the eyes	[('HUMILIATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Out of the thicket stepped a tall old woman, her face quite brown, and her hair of a deep shining black; the whites of her eyes glittered like a Moor's; on her back she carried a bundle, and in her hand a knotted stick.

hair hanging in face hiding the eyes	[('HUMILIATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth.

hands up backing away with a shudder	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A sailor boy had flung his large cap over the bird, and a hand came underneath and caught the clerk by the back and wings so roughly, that he squeaked, and then cried out in his alarm, "You impudent rascal, I am a clerk in the police-office!" but it only sounded to the boy like "tweet, tweet;" so he tapped the bird on the beak, and walked away with him.

sitting at the edge of a chair	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She had an immense desire to get to the edge of the well, and to look over; she felt such a longing for the green, up there; and the next morning, when it chanced that the bucket was being drawn up, filled with water, and stopped for a moment just in front of the stone on which the Toad sat, the little creature's heart moved within it, and our Toad jumped into the filled bucket, which presently was drawn to the top, and emptied out.

sitting at the edge of a chair	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The books travelled all over the world, and some of them came into the hands of the emperor; and he sat in his golden chair, and, as he read, he nodded his approval every moment, for it pleased him to find such a beautiful description of his city, his palace, and his gardens.

covering the mouth with a hand	[('RELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bright color has been changed by age to dark green; but clear, fresh water pours from the snout, which shines as if it had been polished, and so indeed it has, for hundreds of poor people and children seize it in their hands as they place their mouths close to the mouth of the animal, to drink.

a red face and neck	[('HATRED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There was the red wax on the cork, and the bottle looked straight at the young girl's face, and also at the face of the young sailor who sat near her.	N,N
a red face and neck	[('HATRED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	ON the last house in a little village the storks had built a nest, and the mother stork sat in it with her four young ones, who stretched out their necks and pointed their black beaks, which had not yet turned red like those of the parent birds.

a red face and neck	[('HATRED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where the tailor had sewn them together.	N,N
a red face and neck	[('HATRED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he called his daughter and the children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two bright stars in its head.	H,H
a red face and neck	[('HATRED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the tulips stood more stiffly than ever, their faces were pointed and red, because they were vexed.	A,A
a red face and neck	[('HATRED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I blew up the fire in the coals on the hearth, and it threw a red glow on his ghastly white face, lighting it up with a glare, while his sunken eyes looked out wildly from their cavernous depths, and appeared to grow larger and more prominent, as if they would burst from their sockets.

a red face and neck	[('HATRED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The dog never went out in winter, unless she was attired in a little lambskin coat which had been made for her; it was fastened round the little dog's neck and body with red ribbons, and was decorated with rosettes and little bells.	N,N
hiding the hands in the pockets	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Whenever he dozed, he dreamed that he had lost one or another of these possessions; then he would awake with a start, and the first movements of his hand formed a triangle from his right-hand pocket to his breast, and from his breast to his left-hand pocket, to feel whether they were all safe.	N,N
hiding the hands in the pockets	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"You have thriven well in the world hitherto," said the grinder, "now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand in it, your fortune would be made."	N,N

hiding the hands in the pockets	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Yes," said the other, "mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that beautiful goose?"	H,H
hiding the hands in the pockets	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Is that all?" said the tailor, "that is child"s play with us!" and put his hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it.	H,Su+

stumbling back a step	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round.

raising one’s palms	[('DENIAL', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was late on a winter evening; the mountains were covered with snow, but the moon shone brightly, and moonlight in Italy is like a dull winter's day in the north; indeed it is better, for clear air seems to raise us above the earth, while in the north a cold, gray, leaden sky appears to press us down to earth, even as the cold damp earth shall one day press on us in the grave.	N,N
raising one’s palms	[('DENIAL', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She raised herself a little, and glanced at the door of the room where all her flowers and playthings lay; it was partly open, and as she listened, it seemed as if some one in the room was playing the piano, but softly and more prettily than she had ever before heard it.

raising one’s palms	[('DENIAL', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.	Sa,N
raising one’s palms	[('DENIAL', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	THE well was deep, and therefore the rope had to be a long one; it was heavy work turning the handle when any one had to raise a bucketful of water over the edge of the well.	N,N

a preoccupation with one’s appearance	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The gable end of one of these houses faced the street, and with its small, narrow windows, presented a very mean appearance.	N,N
a preoccupation with one’s appearance	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Every one admires the beauty of the apple-bough; but this humble flower has been endowed by Heaven with another kind of loveliness; and although they differ in appearance, both are the children of the realms of beauty."	N,N
bringing up everything that could go wrong	[('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All the good stars of life had brought their gifts to the newly born; here sparkled health, wealth, fortune, and love; in short, there seemed to be everything for which man could wish on earth.	N,N
bringing up everything that could go wrong	[('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He described everything so clearly, that those who listened could see it all; they could see the saw-mills going, the men-servants and the maidens singing songs, and dancing a rattling dance,- when all at once the old goblin gave the old elfin maiden a kiss, such a tremendous kiss, and yet they were almost strangers to each other.	N,N
bringing up everything that could go wrong	[('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But after what he had seen, the goblin could no longer sit and listen quietly to the wisdom and understanding down stairs; so, as soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret, he took courage, for it seemed to him as if the rays of light were strong cables, drawing him up, and obliging him to go and peep through the keyhole; and, while there, a feeling of vastness came over him such as we experience by the ever-moving sea, when the storm breaks forth; and it brought tears into his eyes.

weeping	[('DREAD', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The corpse lay in a bedroom, near to the one in which we sat, and the old man was in great distress and weeping like a child.	Sa,Sa
weeping	[('DREAD', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man hobbled in, and said, "Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you weeping for?"

weeping	[('DREAD', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The mother wept; the father in fancy saw him "famous;" the town musician was of opinion that he ought not to go to war, but should stay at home and learn music.	Sa,Sa

weeping	[('DREAD', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Had I still my old eye, which was broken off, I believe I should weep; but no, I would not do that, it is not genteel to cry."	Sa,Sa

weeping	[('DREAD', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The branches of the old willow-tree rustled in the wind, and large water-drops fell from his green leaves as if the old willow were weeping.	Sa,Sa

weeping	[('DREAD', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then said the maid: "What a clever Elsie we have!" and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune.	Sa,Sa
weeping	[('DREAD', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.	Sa,Sa

a deep gratifying sigh	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He bent his head mournfully, and sighed in deep sorrow, as an unquiet spirit might sigh.	Sa,Sa
a deep gratifying sigh	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And in a few moments deep sighs were heard, as of children weeping.	N,N
a deep gratifying sigh	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But at each "pop," which was a deep sigh, the tree was thinking of a summer day in the forest; and of Christmas evening, and of "Humpty Dumpty," the only story it had ever heard or knew how to relate, till at last it was consumed.	N,N

believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	When he came to his father"s house, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him, and said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would not even give him anything to eat.	N,Sa
believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	She was the boatman's daughter, graceful and delicate as the child of a gentleman; had she been dressed differently, no one would have believed that she lived in a hut on the neighboring heath with her father.	N,N
believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Yes, there was one thing more, an alchymist's glass, a new one, which had been lately bought, and filled with what could be gathered from the ground of the treasure which had promised so much but failed in keeping its promise.	N,N
believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"One might believe that the country was going back to heathenism," he observed.	Su-,N
believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	One night, when her husband listened, as he often did, to her breathing, he quite believed that she had at length found rest and relief in sleep.	N,N
believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	On a beautiful sunny autumn day- one could almost have believed it was still the middle of summer- there hopped about in the dry clean-swept courtyard before the principal entrance of the Hall a number of black, white, and gaily-coloured pigeons, all shining in the sunlight.	N,N
believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	When he awoke, strengthened and restored, the sun shone brightly through the window; but not one of his servants had returned- they all believed he was dead; only the nightingale still sat beside him, and sang.	N,N
believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	They did not leave behind them wealth, they left behind them far less than people had believed they possessed; what there was went to families distantly related to them, of whom, till then, no one had ever heard.	N,N
believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	One day two swindlers came to this city; they made people believe that they were weavers, and declared they could manufacture the finest cloth to be imagined.	N,N
believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	When he learnt the wickedness of his daughter he said, "I cannot believe that she has behaved so ill, but the truth will soon come to light," and bade both go into a secret chamber and keep themselves hidden from every one.	D,N
believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The roses thought that the nightingale was singing about itself, and that one might easily have believed; they had no idea that the song was about them.	N,N
believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	No one could have expected the soul of the watchman to understand it, and yet he did understand it, for our souls have much greater capabilities then we are inclined to believe.	N,N
believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Equally impossible would it have been to believe that the tones of the old bell still echoed in the heart of the boy from Marbach; or that one day they would ring out loud enough and strong enough to be heard all over the world.

believing that one has failed	[('RESIGNATION', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The King would not believe it, and would not suffer any one to do her any injury.	N,N
lying in the other’s lap	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And so it happened that this stone was not cut in two as many others had been, but now lies in the courtyard below, a scouring block for the maids, and a playground for the children.	N,N
lying in the other’s lap	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So they gave him a mouthful of food outside, and at night, when they went to rest, the two others would not let him have a bed, and at last he was forced to creep into the goose-house, and lie down on a little hard straw.	N,N
lying in the other’s lap	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There they found the princess sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was lying asleep, with his head upon her lap.	N,N
lying in the other’s lap	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He opened the door slowly, and one of the princesses was sitting there, and had nine dragon"s heads lying upon her lap, and was combing them.	N,N
lying in the other’s lap	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Away, away!" barked the yard-dog; "I'll tell you; they said I was a pretty little fellow once; then I used to lie in a velvet-covered chair, up at the master's house, and sit in the mistress's lap.	N,N
lying in the other’s lap	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the others went to the bailiff, and told him that the head-man was still lying in bed, and would not go into the wood with them.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Therefore they let him go alone; and as he walked on, the solitude of the wood produced a feeling of reverence in his breast; but still he heard the little bell about which the others rejoiced, and sometimes, when the wind blew in that direction, he could hear the sounds from the confectioner's stall, where the others were singing at tea.	N,H
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The poor people in the town, and still more the strangers, were continually making mistakes in the people they wanted to see; nor was this to be avoided, when they went according to the shields that were hung up.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest: but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes.	Sa,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Tom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called out, "My good friend, I can show you a famous treat."	N,H
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So Anthony invented employment; he mended his clothes and patched his boots, and when he at last went to bed,- his nightcap, which he had worn from habit, still remained on his head; he had only to pull it down a little farther over his forehead.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"He is still alive," said the huntsman; "and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him go in peace, and brought home his royal coat."	H,H
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it for the king"s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.	N,Su-
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He travelled about a long time in search of it and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for fourteen days and still could not find a way out.	F,Sa
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When one of the chickens was swallowed down, and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said: "What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what"s right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take another draught it would do me no harm."	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the others went to the bailiff, and told him that the head-man was still lying in bed, and would not go into the wood with them.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then Hans hastened home and brought a fowler"s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she still went on sleeping.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to the table and ate.	H,H
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When she arose the next morning, she went quickly to the little table, to see if the flowers were still there.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the Lord said he was to go down into the cellar, for the best wine was still there.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But they still went on, and Death nodded like a Chinaman to all they said.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and said:	F,F
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The boat was moored; and the two men, after desiring the children to sit still, both went on shore. they obeyed this order for a very short time, and then forgot it altogether.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later on he married again.	Sa,Sa
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The conversation on this topic was only interrupted for a moment by the arrival of a newspaper, which did not, however, contain much worth reading, and while it is still going on we will pay a visit to the ante-room, in which cloaks, sticks, and goloshes were carefully placed.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it as before; but to her great grief it still said:	A,Sa
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Had he known that it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before him, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I went up to him, and took his hand, and said, 'Do you still feel the same for me?' 'Yes; ever and always,' said he.	H,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	That was still not enough for the giant; he again suckled him for two years, and when he then went with him into the forest and said, "Now just tear up a proper stick for me," the boy tore up the strongest oak-tree from the earth, so that it split, and that was a mere trifle to him.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But when evening came and she still stayed away, Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the corn asleep.	Su+,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Her terror too would not quit her, let her do what she might, and her heart beat continually and would not be still; the gold too stayed on her finger, and would not go away, let her rub it and wash it never so much.	F,F
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	People came and went, mass was performed, but no one noticed the boy, excepting an elderly citizen, who stood still and looked at him for a moment, and then went away like the rest.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Three young huntsmen also went out, and when they had travelled about for eight days, they arrived at a great castle, in which were beautiful apartments, and in one room a table was laid on which were delicate dishes which were still so warm that they were smoking, but in the whole of the castle no human being was either to be seen or heard.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then suddenly the sound of the bell was heard so beautifully and solemnly from the wood that four or five made up their minds to go still further on.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she went home and planted it, and immediately there grew up a large handsome flower, something like a tulip in appearance, but with its leaves tightly closed as if it were still a bud.	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She got out of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he still continued sleeping.	A,Sa
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not return, the man said to the woman: "Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is!"	N,N
stiffening and going still	[('WARINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And they hovered about there in the air, and could not get to each other, and whether they are still hovering about, or not, I do not know, but the young giant took up his iron bar, and went on his way.	N,N

holding in a breath	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I heard him sighing like a soul in despair; I heard him praying, and I noticed how he held his breath.	Sa,Sa
holding in a breath	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The children held them to their mouths, and tried to blow away the whole coronal with one puff of the breath.	N,N
wet eyes	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before.	H,H
telling the unvarnished truth	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"There is no real pleasure in travelling," said mamma; "to tell the truth, it's very wearisome; I beg pardon for saying so.	D,D
telling the unvarnished truth	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	To tell the truth--old Mr. Bouncer had forgotten them.	N,N
telling the unvarnished truth	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I may tell you unpleasant truths, but that is a proof of my friendship.	N,N
telling the unvarnished truth	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Thereupon the Virgin Mary appeared to her in the night when she lay in her bed alone, and said, "If thou wilt tell the truth and confess that thou didst unlock the forbidden door, I will open thy mouth and give thee back thy speech, but if thou perseverest in thy sin, and deniest obstinately, I will take thy new-born child away with me."	N,N
telling the unvarnished truth	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the fowls of the neighborhood were all awake, and, to tell the truth, they had paid a visit to the duckyard, simply and solely to find food for themselves.	N,N
telling the unvarnished truth	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken into favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.	H,N
telling the unvarnished truth	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Well, this is a wonderful cat!" thought Hans, "but I am determined to see if she is telling the truth."	Su+,N
telling the unvarnished truth	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"May I never be whipped again," said the top, "if I am not telling you the truth."	N,N
telling the unvarnished truth	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he answered, "To tell the truth I did not cook it, but Cat-skin did."	N,N
telling the unvarnished truth	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I can only tell people the truth," said she.	N,N
shifting back and forth	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then her voice came back to her, and she cried out loudly, "Yes, Mary, I did it;" and straight-way rain fell from the sky and extinguished the flames of fire, and a light broke forth above her, and the Virgin Mary descended with the two little sons by her side, and the new-born daughter in her arms.	F,F
shifting back and forth	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I can never go back to my father"s house," said he; "they would say I am a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to my kingdom."	N,N
shifting back and forth	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Instead of returning to the king, however, he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron Hans.	H,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	They all said "Oh!" and held up their forefingers and nodded, but a poor fisherman, who had heard the real nightingale, said, "it sounds prettily enough, and the melodies are all alike; yet there seems something wanting, I cannot exactly tell what."	N,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	She sprang up and wanted to run away, but whithersoever she turned herself, she was continually held back by thick hedges of thorns through which she could not break.	N,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	First they peeped into the basket containing the eels and the sucking-pig; then they must needs pull out the pig and take it in their hands, and feel it, and touch it; and as they both wanted to hold it at the same time, the consequence was that they let it fall into the water, and the pig sailed away with the stream.	Su-,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.	N,Su+
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	When she knew the answer to the riddle she wanted to steal away, but he held her mantle so fast that she was forced to leave it behind her.	Su-,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life was in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he wanted before the clock struck twelve.	N,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats.	Su-,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"Hold fast! hold fast!" the spectre would cry; and as Anne Lisbeth murmured these words to herself, the whole of her dream was suddenly recalled to her memory, when the mother had clung to her, and uttered these words, when, amid the crashing of worlds, her sleeve had been torn, and she had slipped from the grasp of her child, who wanted to hold her up in that terrible hour.	N,F
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then he wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him, and said, "Listen, my friend, to what I am going to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak.	H,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The following day the king"s daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it, she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it fast with both hands.	Su-,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The old man held his tongue, but Heinel said again, "What do you want here?"	N,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: "I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening.	H,Sa
repeating the truth as one sees it and sticking to it	[('DENIAL', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The boar, however, had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, "Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame."	A,Su+
avoiding a person or place	[('GUILT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered that each brick, when finished, brought him in a small coin, if only a copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one upon another, can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a person knocks, who has a number of these in his hands, whether it be the baker's, the butcher's, or the tailor's, the door flies open, and he can get all he wants.	Su+,N
avoiding a person or place	[('GUILT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The King had placed sentries at all the gates, and it was not possible to avoid his fate.	N,N
moving about being unable to settle in one place	[('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now at the gate each suitor was provided with a number, and all were placed in rows immediately on their arrival, six in each row, and so closely packed together that they could not move their arms; and that was a prudent arrangement, for they would certainly have come to blows, had they been able, merely because one of them stood before the other.	N,N
moving about being unable to settle in one place	[('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Presently a fly settled on one of them and it moved.	N,N
waving a hand in dismissal	[('SMUGNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy.	Su-,H
waving a hand in dismissal	[('SMUGNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The Danish and the Swedish flags wave, and Danes and Swedes say, "Good-day," and "Thank you" to each other, not with cannons, but with a friendly shake of the hand; and they exchange white bread and biscuits with each other, because foreign articles taste the best.	N,N
waving a hand in dismissal	[('SMUGNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, "Stop thief."	A,N
ribs squeezing tight	[('ENVY', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	He squeezed through the hole in the wall and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.	N,N
ribs squeezing tight	[('ENVY', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they did not break his ribs.	N,N
making demands	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	My mother could make fishermen's nets, for which there was a great demand here in the bay; and we lived a long time by the side of the sea, the beautiful sea, that had a taste like tears, and in its colors reminded me of the stag that wept red tears; for sometimes its waters were red, and sometimes green or blue.	N,N
making demands	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third demand.	N,N
making demands	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	So he took a great stone which was lying there, and placed it in the basket, and when it was about half way up, his false brothers above cut the rope, so that the basket with the stone fell to the ground, and they thought that he was dead, and ran away with the three princesses, making them promise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them, and then they went to the King, and each demanded a princess in marriage.	N,N
begging people to stop	[('AMUSEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train before the king"s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite loudly, and as if she would never stop.	H,H
begging people to stop	[('AMUSEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	At first the thing was merry and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties, till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him the hundred florins.	F,Sa
begging people to stop	[('AMUSEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The little one would not grow, for he was only a common snail; but the old people, particularly the mother-snail, declared that she could easily see how he grew; and when the father said he could not perceive it, she begged him to feel the little snail's shell, and he did so, and found that the mother was right.	N,N
begging people to stop	[('AMUSEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	People used to stop and peep through the railings.	N,N
begging people to stop	[('AMUSEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, "Stop, stop!" and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their carriage.	Su+,Sa
taking one’s anger out on innocent bystanders	[('ANGER', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The tears of her husband fell on her forehead, but she took no notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered.	Sa,Sa
taking one’s anger out on innocent bystanders	[('ANGER', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him: "If the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother."	D,N
clasping hands to the chest	[('HAPPINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There he lay stretched on his bed, dead, with his old nightcap tightly clasped in his two hands.	N,N
clasping hands to the chest	[('HAPPINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"'Yes, to-day is your golden wedding-day,' said the little elder-tree mother, stretching her head down between the two old people, who thought that she was their neighbour who was nodding to them; they looked at each other and clasped hands.	H,N
clasping hands to the chest	[('HAPPINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he seized the chest in his hand and lifted it up a little, as if he were going to throw it into the water.	N,N
a visible flush in cheeks	[('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Her powers of body were almost exhausted, but her eyes flashed brightly, and on her cheeks was a rosy flush.	N,N
arms straight hands locked into fists	[('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The boy went on his way with his cap in his hand, while the wind fluttered his golden hair till the locks stood up straight.	N,N
lips parting slightly	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he kissed her lips; and so they parted.	H,N
asking for time to make the decision	[('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought: "I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure to know."	F,N
pretending to not have heard or seen	[('EMBARRASSMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	When a year was over, the young Queen bore a son, and as the step-mother had heard of her great good-fortune, she came with her daughter to the palace and pretended that she wanted to pay her a visit.	N,N
pretending to not have heard or seen	[('EMBARRASSMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	In the evening when he came home and heard that he had a son he was heartily glad, and was going to the bed of his dear wife to see how she was.	H,H
pretending to not have heard or seen	[('EMBARRASSMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	You prayed for him, but it was no good, he was to ride until his limbs were paralysed; but you stole down to him, as I steal now to you, you yourself put little stones under each of his feet that he might have support, nobody saw it, or they pretended not to see it, for you were then the young gracious mistress.	Su+,N
pretending to not have heard or seen	[('EMBARRASSMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The chamberlains, who were to carry the train, stretched their hands to the ground as if they lifted up a train, and pretended to hold something in their hands; they did not like people to know that they could not see anything.	N,F
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The one in the middle held a mussel in its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth"s feet, and when he had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had put on the emperor's golden crown, and held in one hand his sword of state, and in the other his beautiful banner.	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.	H,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	First top off, then half-done, then--" "Will you hold your tongue," cried the cat, "one word more, and I will eat you too."	A,A
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The children held them to their mouths, and tried to blow away the whole coronal with one puff of the breath.	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There he sat one day, and held his magnifying-glass to his eye, and looked at a drop of water that had been taken out of a puddle by the ditch.	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.	N,Su+
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When any one takes one of these and holds it to his eye, and looks at a drop of water from the pond yonder, he sees above a thousand wonderful creatures that are otherwise never discerned in the water.	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Well, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax, and pulled it up by the roots; this was painful; then it was laid in water as if they intended to drown it; and, after that, placed near a fire as if it were to be roasted; all this was very shocking.	Su-,Su-
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when she really had the little child in her arms, and held it up to its father, then it was like one of the angels in the church to behold, with hair like gold- the gleam of the setting sun was upon it.	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There they lay with their anger, holding their heads on one side and blinking the eye that was turned upwards.	A,A
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She sat in splendid rooms, richly decorated with silk and velvet; not a breath of air was allowed to blow upon her, and no one was allowed to speak to her harshly, for she was nurse to the count's child.	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His eyes were as clear and his face was as radiant as sunshine; and he held his mother in his arms, and she kissed his mouth, and wept as blissfully as any one can weep for joy; and he nodded at every old piece of furniture in the room, at the cupboard with the tea-cups, and at the flower-vase.	H,H
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now he had carved Holger Danske, who stood there erect and proud, with his long beard, holding in one hand his broad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the Danish arms.	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But it happened one day that a feast was to be held in the king"s castle, so she said to the cook, "May I go up a little while and see what is going on?	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	This bottle would hold so much more than the little one, and they all said the brandy would be so good for complaints of the stomach, especially as it was mixed with medical herbs.	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I heard him sighing like a soul in despair; I heard him praying, and I noticed how he held his breath.	Sa,Sa
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It is so cold outside that one"s very breath freezes!	Su-,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"He says that you must go and open that large chest which stands in the corner, and you will see the evil one crouching down inside; but you must hold the lid firmly, that he may not slip out."	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and no one could hold the miser.	A,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The old councillor, who had received three medals for holding his tongue, declared that the Skipjack possessed the gift of prophecy; one could tell by his bones whether there would be a severe winter or a mild one; and that's more than one can always tell from the breastbone of the man who writes the almanac.	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the fox felt the first string, he started so that he one leg, from pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs.	A,A
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, "I never saw any one half so beautiful."	H,H
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with the other took his son out of the horse"s ear, and put him down upon a straw, where he sat as merry as you please.	N,H
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The child still sat, in the stiffness of death, holding the matches in her hand, one bundle of which was burnt.	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They placed him on the table, and- how many curious things do happen in the world!- there he was in the very same room from the window of which he had fallen, there were the same children, the same playthings, standing on the table, and the pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door; she still balanced herself on one leg, and held up the other, so she was as firm as himself.	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, "All is not right; someone took hold of my gown."	F,F
bending the neck forward	[('DISAPPOINTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Come, now, don't turn your toes, a well-bred duckling spreads his feet wide apart, just like his father and mother, in this way; now bend your neck, and say 'quack.'"	N,N
bending the neck forward	[('DISAPPOINTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The elder children broke off the flowers with long stems, bent the stalks one round the other, to form links, and made first a chain for the neck, then one to go across the shoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a wreath to wear round the head, so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands of green stems and golden flowers.	N,N
difficulty staying still	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	They waited there for half a day, and the food still remained warm and smoking, and at length they were so hungry that they sat down and ate, and agreed with each other that they would stay and live in that castle, and that one of them, who should be chosen by casting lots, should remain in the house, and the two others seek the King"s daughters.	N,N
difficulty staying still	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	But when evening came and she still stayed away, Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the corn asleep.	Su+,N
difficulty staying still	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Her terror too would not quit her, let her do what she might, and her heart beat continually and would not be still; the gold too stayed on her finger, and would not go away, let her rub it and wash it never so much.	F,F
difficulty staying still	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	All went right: then the fox said, "When you come to the castle where the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and when you get it into your hand, ride away."	N,N
placing hands on the hips	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered that each brick, when finished, brought him in a small coin, if only a copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one upon another, can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a person knocks, who has a number of these in his hands, whether it be the baker's, the butcher's, or the tailor's, the door flies open, and he can get all he wants.	Su+,N
placing hands on the hips	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The presents of gold and precious stones which had been received with it were round the bird, and it was now advanced to the title of "Little Imperial Toilet Singer," and to the rank of No. 1 on the left hand; for the emperor considered the left side, on which the heart lies, as the most noble, and the heart of an emperor is in the same place as that of other people.	N,N
placing hands on the hips	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The son said: "Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower," and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.	H,H
placing hands on the hips	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The inscription "Institution for Superior Education" was found near the billiard club, which place of resort was further adorned with the words, "Children brought up by hand."	N,N
placing hands on the hips	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So they made a boat out of a newspaper, and placed the tin soldier in it, and sent him sailing down the gutter, while the two boys ran by the side of it, and clapped their hands.	H,H
placing hands on the hips	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of her top drawer; then she set the boy"s head again on his shoulders, and bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.	N,N
placing hands on the hips	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bright color has been changed by age to dark green; but clear, fresh water pours from the snout, which shines as if it had been polished, and so indeed it has, for hundreds of poor people and children seize it in their hands as they place their mouths close to the mouth of the animal, to drink.	N,N
eyes that glow	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I blew up the fire in the coals on the hearth, and it threw a red glow on his ghastly white face, lighting it up with a glare, while his sunken eyes looked out wildly from their cavernous depths, and appeared to grow larger and more prominent, as if they would burst from their sockets.	N,N
drinking until passing out to forget	[('GUILT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Soon afterwards the children and grandchildren came, for they knew very well that it was the golden wedding-day; they had already wished them joy and happiness in the morning, but the old people had forgotten it, although they remembered things so well that had passed many, many years ago.	N,N
drinking until passing out to forget	[('GUILT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"I have no water," said the captive lark, "they have all gone out, and forgotten to give me anything to drink.	Sa,N
drinking until passing out to forget	[('GUILT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	So he laid the stone carefully by his side on the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.	Su-,Su-
drinking until passing out to forget	[('GUILT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But Little Claus soon forgot what he ought to say, and when any one passed he would call out, "Gee-up, my five horses!"	N,N
drinking until passing out to forget	[('GUILT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, "Stop, stop!" and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their carriage.	Su+,Sa
backing away with raised hands	[('PARANOIA', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A sailor boy had flung his large cap over the bird, and a hand came underneath and caught the clerk by the back and wings so roughly, that he squeaked, and then cried out in his alarm, "You impudent rascal, I am a clerk in the police-office!" but it only sounded to the boy like "tweet, tweet;" so he tapped the bird on the beak, and walked away with him.	A,F
sidelong glances while keeping the head still	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last I went down to the cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head still.	N,N
sidelong glances while keeping the head still	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The smaller of the two represented a little boy sitting at a table, drawing; before him was a little white poodle, curiously shaven; but as the animal would not stand still, it had been fastened with a string to its head and tail, to keep it in one position.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bottle had no time to think, when raised so suddenly; and before it was aware, it reached the highest point it had ever attained in its life.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now something rustled among the bushes, and a little boy stood before the king's son, in wooden shoes and such a short jacket that the sleeves did not reach to his wrists.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to kill his brother.	A,A
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When Little Claus reached home again, he immediately sent a boy to Great Claus, requesting him to lend him a bushel measure.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When she reached the dwarfs" cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, "Fine wares to sell!"	A,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The man journeyed on day and night till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the leaf floated down the stream, carrying Tiny far away out of reach of land.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was late in the evening when we reached my mother's door.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As he reached the half-open door, he saw a light and went in.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I shall be obliged to go back to the king's new market," said he, "where there are plenty of carriages standing, or I shall never reach Christian's Haven."	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The door was locked, and he could not reach the knocker.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was dangerously ill, and near his death.	F,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	On reaching the entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every step she took.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached her the golden slipper.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The Florentine, Angiolo Bronzino, painted this picture; most beautiful is the expression on the face of the two children, who appear to have full confidence that they shall reach heaven at last.	H,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The volunteer had, however, presence of mind enough to whisper, "It is for a wager;" but the first thing he did, when he reached his own room, was to put a large blister on his neck, and another on his back, that his crazy fit might be cured.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.	F,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The laundress slipped and tottered through the lane, and round the corner, into the street where the mayor lived; and just as she reached the front of his house, she sank down upon the pavement.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The written leaf, the last farewell of the bridegroom to his bride, would only bring sorrow when once it reached her hands; but where were those hands, so soft and delicate, which had once spread the table-cloth on the fresh grass in the green wood, on the day of her betrothal?	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was carried away farther and farther from the shore, till it reached the open sea.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he reached home, the two other apprentices were there again as well, and each of them certainly had brought a horse with him, but one of them was a blind one, and the other lame.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As he grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth, so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, bright sun itself.	H,H
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All night long they walked, and it was morning before they reached the mill.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon you for ever."	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And then, taking hold of the creepers and roots, he climbed up on the wet stones, where water-snakes were wriggling and the toads, as it were, barked at him: he reached the top before the sun, seen from such a height, had quite set.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the king"s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Get money," she replied; "for you must know that when you reach the ground under the tree, you will find yourself in a large hall, lighted up by three hundred lamps; you will then see three doors, which can be easily opened, for the keys are in all the locks.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then reached the ship and got home safe.	H,H
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I have been well paid for my horse," said he to himself when he reached home, entered his own room, and emptied all his money into a heap on the floor.	H,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After he had taken the maiden up on his horse, the old woman showed him the way, and the King reached his royal palace again, where the wedding was celebrated.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"This tree I shall guard and cherish," she said, "that it may grow large by Christmas Eve, and reach from the ground to the ceiling, to be covered and adorned with flaming candles, golden apples, and little figures.	H,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The King took her in his arms, carried her to his horse, and rode home with her, and when he reached the royal castle he caused her to be dressed in beautiful garments, and gave her all things in abundance.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Under the shield of the Pope, the law cannot reach thee; but Jens Glob shall reach thee!"	A,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The tiny little creature woke very early in the morning, and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was, for she could see nothing but water on every side of the large green leaf, and no way of reaching the land.	Sa,Sa
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As soon as the stone was laden, it began to rise up on high with the maiden and the young man, and mounted through the opening of the ceiling into the upper hall, from whence they then could easily reach the open air.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the procession went onwards, and they reached the stream.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	However, the duck, who slept in the open air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	You will reach a village in the evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you to be very poor and mean."	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And as she danced past the open church door she saw an angel there in long white robes, with wings reaching from his shoulders down to the earth; his face was stern and grave, and in his hand he held a broad shining sword.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He went to the tower in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he would rise from his bed, creep down the ladder- for it could scarcely be called a flight of stairs- and when he reached the fire-pan not a spark could be seen; so he had just to go back again to bed.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So Gambling Hansel went, but when he reached the house where the other gambling vagabonds were gathered together, they, although they had won all that he had, greeted him clamorously, and said, "Hansel, do come in."	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He tried it; but before he reached the entry, the rest discovered what he was about, and seized him by the feet, when, luckily for him, off came the goloshes, and with them vanished the whole enchantment.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he ordered his servants to bring costly coverings and wrap him in them, that the gnats might no longer be able to reach him.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the wild wood-path they met a forester who knew Ib, and, by his help, Ib and Christina reached home, where they found every one had been very anxious about them.	H,F
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	We reached our old home; but the cottage was in ruins, and we had to build a new one.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	To Egypt, where we shall see three-cornered houses built of stone, with pointed tops that reach nearly to the clouds.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Tiny pleased him, and she was glad of it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her, and the country through which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone upon the water, till it glittered like liquid gold.	H,H
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So Little Claus climbed to the roof of the shed, and while he turned himself to get comfortable, he discovered that the wooden shutters, which were closed, did not reach to the tops of the windows of the farmhouse, so that he could see into a room, in which a large table was laid out with wine, roast meat, and a splendid fish.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Borglum's bishop reaches the church; but Olaf Hase will scarce do so, however hard he may ride.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The girl reached the plate to him, but the king"s son threw off the quilt, and said: "You old sinner, why did you want to kill me?	A,Su-
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: "Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold."	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the people had reached the sea-wall, where the sparks were flying round.	H,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At length they reached the warm countries, where the sun shines brightly, and the sky seems so much higher above the earth.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had dared to attempt to reach foreign territories unnoticed, and must therefore give up fatherland, mother, his dearest friends, all, or sink down into the stream of common life.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to himself, "I will remain here and wait for her," so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king"s daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.	Sa,Sa
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther.	F,F
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the woodman laughed, and said, "How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse"s bridle."	H,Su-
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar.	Su+,Su+
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when night came on, they went into a wood to sleep.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ten of them are carried away; but Olaf Hase and two of the youngest men reach the farther side.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Though the water was clear, the sun never looked down far enough into the well to mirror itself in the waters; but as far as its beams could reach, green things grew forth between the stones in the sides of the well.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was the dawn of morning before the wicked man reached home; he took off his hat, and went into his sister's room.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she took off the hinges, and said, "Frederick told me to lock the door, but surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me."	Su-,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The road led him up a mountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him.	H,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the darkness he saw a small light; he went towards it and reached a cottage.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then up he got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till he reached his mother"s house, and told her how very easy the road to good luck was.	H,H
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I got out of bed, and reached the window; I could not crawl any farther from weakness and exhaustion; but I managed to open the window.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They are addressed in the language of their country, and the piano sounds for them with melodies of their native land; and before these have died away, the chord has been struck, the wire of thought that reaches to the land of the sufferers announces that they are rescued.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The boy never forgot what his mother told him, and the tones of the old bell reverberated in his heart till he reached manhood.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At two o"clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses; but even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, "I know he has fallen asleep."	Sa,A
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She drove across the country in a grazier's cart, and then got out, and continued her journey on foot, and thus reached the count's castle.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had a long way to go before he reached the river, and Little Claus was not a very light weight to carry.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they reached the farmyard, there was a great disturbance, two families were fighting for an eel's head, which, after all, was carried off by the cat.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was as well formed and as beautiful as a little child could be, and had wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The window stood open the whole day, and the little elf could easily have reached the roses, or any of the flowers; but he could not find it in his heart to leave one so afflicted.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It has struck, and is fast embedded in the sand; but the rocket apparatus has thrown a rope on board, and formed a bridge from the wreck to the mainland; and all on board are saved, and reach the land, and are wrapped in warm blankets; and to-day they are invited to the farm at the convent of Borglum.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They reached home safely, and burst into the rabbit hole.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So as soon as he reached home he took the largest sack he could find and went over to Little Claus.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In olden times, when the Lord himself still used to walk about on this earth amongst men, it once happened that he was tired and overtaken by the darkness before he could reach an inn.	N,Sa
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He could scarcely reach the water jug that he had placed by his bed, and the last drop was gone.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I am willing," said the fox, and showed him the by-paths and ways by which at length they reached the cellar.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They walked on till they reached the picture gallery, and mounted the same staircase up which he had ridden that night on the Metal Pig.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She remembered that the route by the sea-shore was two miles shorter than by the high road; and as the weather was clear, and there would be moonlight, she determined to make her way on foot, and to start at once, that she might reach home the next day.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His wings were dry now, so they carried him to a great distance, till at last he reached a hothouse, where a sash of the glass roof was partly open, so he quietly slipped in and buried himself in the warm earth.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The porter's bell he was unable to reach, and however was he to get loose!	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the cock drew the carriage himself, but when he got it over and reached the other shore with the dead hen, and was about to draw over the others who were sitting behind as well, there were too many of them, the carriage ran back, and they all fell into the water together, and were drowned.	Su-,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	By sunrise they reached a large inn, where Little Claus stopped and went to get something to eat.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he reached the gate of the castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick, and it flew wide open at once and he passed through.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He rose up without delay, eager to start on his way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which direction he ought to go.	Su+,H
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Alas! dear sir," said she, "yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only the birds and the flies--man cannot."	Sa,Sa
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ferry me across first," said the luck-child, "and then I will tell you how you can be set free," and when he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil"s advice: "Next time any one comes, who wants to be ferried over, just put the oar in his hand."	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The tailor felt in his pockets, and reached him a handful; they were, however, not nuts, but pebbles.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince"s kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great many years.	H,H
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But it had to travel, till at length it reached land- a foreign country.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But when she began her song, and it reached Roland"s ears, he sprang up and cried: "I know the voice, that is the true bride, I will have no other!"	Su+,Su+
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They both rowed with all their strength day and night, and their little boat flew so swiftly that they reached the old King before the others did.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There not even the light of a torch or lantern could reach it, much less the brightness of the sun or moon.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him: "You will never see your father and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free, and I have compassion on you.	Sa,N
gasping	[('RELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When his request was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water.	N,Sa
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	From one Shrove Tuesday to another, much may occur to weigh down the heart; it is the reckoning of a whole year; much may be forgotten, sins against heaven in word and thought, sins against our neighbor, and against our own conscience.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Everything was finished except just one single cherry-coloured buttonhole, and where that buttonhole was wanting there was pinned a scrap of paper with these words--in little teeny weeny writing--	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	First top off, then half-done, then--" "Will you hold your tongue," cried the cat, "one word more, and I will eat you too."	A,A
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Garden plant!" he said to the cucumber, and in that one word his deep learning showed itself, and it forgot that he was pecking at her and eating it up.	Su+,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The tears of her husband fell on her forehead, but she took no notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered.	Sa,Sa
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Don't say one word.	F,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for some time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it, sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes.	N,Sa
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He took up little Thumbling carefully with two fingers, examined him, and without saying one word went away with him.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"There was only one word that was not clear to me.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He became at last desperate; and when one of them said he was tipsy, he did not doubt the man's word in the least- only begged them to get a droschky; and then they thought he was speaking the Muscovite language.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	From the organ in the church sounded the music and the words of the beautiful psalms, which were written in the old book under the head of the dead one.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then I rushed against the house and the old lime-trees with such force, that one of the thickest branches, a decayed one, was broken off, and the branch fell at the entrance, and remained there.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last the turn came for that brother who knew the dictionary by heart; but he did not know it now; he had absolutely forgotten it altogether; and the boards seemed to re-echo with his footsteps, and the ceiling of the hall was made of looking-glass, so that he saw himself standing on his head; and at the window stood three clerks and a head clerk, and every one of them was writing down every single word that was uttered, so that it might be printed in the newspapers, and sold for a penny at the street corners.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he rang very loud, so that those above heard him, and he placed the princesses one after the other in the basket, and had them all drawn up, but when it came to his own turn he remembered the words of the elf, who had told him that his comrades did not mean well by him.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She reddened from brow to neck, and answered not a single word; and then strangers came into the room, and one of them was the state councillor's son.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now she could not say another word against the wedding because she had given a promise before every one, and the King ordered a carriage to be brought in which she was to drive to church with the tailor, and there she was to be married.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And if one single word falls from thy lips, all thy work will be lost."	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But when the old woman stole away the newly-born child for the third time, and accused the Queen, who did not utter one word of defence, the King could do no otherwise than deliver her over to justice, and she was sentenced to suffer death by fire.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when she opened her mouth, and was about to tell her mother what had happened to her in the wood, with every word she said, a toad sprang out of her mouth, so that every one was seized with horror of her.	Su-,F
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She was of few words, and of a dark countenance; but she did not know how to climb, so I blew her overboard before any one found out that she was a woman; and, in my opinion, that was well done," said the Wind.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It cannot even be said of the ducks, and we warn you, little bird, not to trust that one yonder, with the short tail feathers, for she is cunning; that curiously marked one, with the crooked stripes on her wings, is a mischief-maker, and never lets any one have the last word, though she is always in the wrong.	D,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Umbrellas, sticks, and hats swung in the net before him, and almost obstructed the prospect, which was really very imposing; and as he glanced at it, his memory recalled the words of one poet at least, who has sung of Switzerland, and whose poems have not yet been printed:-	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The old high-road is lost amid cultivated fields; the new one now winds along over covered graves; and soon the railway will come, with its train of carriages, and rush over graves where lie those whose very names are forgoten.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Every one speaks these words in his own language.	N,N
rushing one’s words	[('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the music-master made a little speech, full of hard words, and declared that the bird was as good as ever; and, of course no one contradicted him.	N,N

looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The barber's shield, the great brazen dish, was carried away, and hurled straight into the embrasure of the councillor of justice; and the whole neighborhood said this looked almost like malice, inasmuch as they, and nearly all the friends of the councillor's wife, used to call that lady "the Razor" for she was so sharp that she knew more about other people's business than they knew about it themselves.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They were come to take a last farewell look of their mother.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It looked really like a great town reflected there, in which all the people were running about without clothes.	Su-,N

looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There she saw a lonely house, looking so grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all.	F,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Care vanished, and with her the goloshes; doubtless she looked upon them as her own property.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She still remembered what in her childhood's days her mother had looked upon as the greatest among the beautiful.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"There isn't a patty-pan," said Ribby, looking perplexed.	N,Su-

looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I don't want to talk to them, and it looks miserable here- that's my opinion."	D,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At home the shoes were put into the cupboard, but Karen could not help looking at them.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Meantime the countryman began to look grave, and shook his head.	Sa,A
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the queen said, "Only look at my beautiful combs!" and gave her the poisoned one.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah! well," he thought, "who knows? perhaps I may fall down too, and marry a princess;" and he looked forward joyfully to the next evening, expecting to be again decked out with lights and playthings, gold and fruit.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Miss Moppet holds her poor head in her paws and looks at him through a hole in the duster.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.	N,Sa

looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.	A,A
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he went his way, and in the evening came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty, and poor.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him.	Su-,Su-
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He walked about in a coat embroidered all over, and in the drawing-rooms of society looked just like one of those rich pearl-embroidered bell-pulls, which are only made for show; and behind them always hangs a good thick cord for use.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The Fowl looked at it first with one eye and then with the other, for she did not know what the end of this writhing would be.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the apple-branch looked with a sort of pity upon them, especially on a certain little flower that is found in fields and in ditches.	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Meantime the huntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, "I have been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle and rest myself, for I have money enough to pay for anything I want"; but the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful lady.	Su+,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked at the little lady, and she looked at him.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There was a look of wealth about the house of Borreby at that time.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They looked so inviting that the children could not help stopping; and they remained there so long eating, that their mouths and cheeks became quite black with the juice.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now, you must attentively listen to her and look at the beautiful elder-tree.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they went through all the rooms, till they came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door was a wicket, so that they could look into the next room.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They shouldered arms and looked straight before them, and wore a splendid uniform, red and blue.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	You must strut about proudly- it will look well and make you respected."	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They had therefore to go out and look for the second time.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The stitches of those buttonholes were so small--SO small--they looked as if they had been made by little mice!	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He spoke to him softly and pleasantly, and begged him not to take it amiss that he had not let him in directly; he was looking for the front-door key, and in the meantime the stranger had gone away, if he returned the same way he must come and stay with him.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last he looked round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.	N,Su-
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"O Frederick!" answered she, "I was cooking you a steak; but while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!"	D,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they came to the village, the son followed the fox"s counsel, and without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all night at his ease.	N,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Corn grows in the surrounding fields, not only rye and barley, but oats,-pretty oats that, when ripe, look like a number of little golden canary-birds sitting on a bough.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But one day Ib succeeded so well in his carving that he made two pieces of wood look really like two little wooden shoes, and he determined to give them as a present to Little Christina.	Su+,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	How much came back to his remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native town!	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The Christmas lights rose higher and higher, till they looked to her like the stars in the sky.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Have you not seen those beautiful red, white. and yellow butterflies, that look like flowers?	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not.	D,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"That would be a fine thing!" cried the miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.	Su+,Su+
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The blossoms looked like large painted horns; and he thought to himself, he would go and sleep in one of these till the morning.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But still it was a shelter, and from within you could look far over the sea, which dashed wildly against the sea-wall on which the little house was built.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The three daughters went every day beneath the tree, and looked to see if the wind had not blown down an apple, but they never by any chance found one, and the tree was so loaded with them that it was almost breaking, and the branches hung down to the ground.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, "Five."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The three little elves peeped out again, but she did not greet them, and without looking round at them and without speaking to them, she went awkwardly into the room, seated herself by the stove, and began to eat her bread-and-butter and cake.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Her youngest child, looked for in the midst of prosperity, had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old; and at last Christina herself became sick unto death, and lay, forsaken and dying, in a miserable room, amid poverty she might have borne in her younger days, but which was now more painful to her from the luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed.

looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I do not think"--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten--"I do NOT think it will be a good pudding.	A,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"They are like wet wood," he would say, looking round to see what sort of people were present, "this evening; nothing fires them."	D,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He slept and yet he did not sleep; and it appeared as if the old washerwoman looked at him with kind eyes and said, "It would be a great pity if you did not know your lesson to-morrow morning; you helped me, and now I will help you, and Providence will always keep those who help themselves;" and at the same time the book under Tuk's pillow began to move about.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his white beard hung down.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	That was their way of looking foolish.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Look what I have found on the high road."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"It is beautiful here in spring," said the little girl, and they were again in the green beechwood, where the thyme breathed forth sweet fragrance at their feet, and the pink anemones looked lovely in the green moss.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Have you looked behind the large cask?" said one of the others.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said "good morning" to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up.	N,F
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and said, "This is the right bride."	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: "You may ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must be things without life."	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Miss Moppet looks worse and worse.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	These loose, airy wool-flowers are very beautiful, and look like fine snowy feathers or down.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Half ashamed, yet glad at heart, it looked over to the other flowers in the garden; surely they had witnessed its pleasure and the honour that had been done to it; they understood its joy.	N,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	You can look into the room from where you stand, and see where I was master once; for I was indeed master to the housekeeper.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And Peter sat by her a long time, and she looked at him with gentle eyes.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Years passed; then one day she met the old friend and sweetheart in the street; he looked ill and miserable, and she could not help asking him, "How are you?"	Su-,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He placed it in his prayer-book, and when he opened it in distant lands it was always at the place where the flower of remembrance was lying; and the more he looked at it the fresher it became, so that he could almost smell the fragrance of the woods at home.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Look sharp!" said the king to the huntsmen, "and see what sort of game lies there."	Su+,Su+
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All the servants stood below in the courtyard, and looked on while they mounted their horses; and just by chance the third son came up.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and cried: "Ah, poor Crabb."	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah," she answered, "I am to look for a basketful of strawberries, and am not to go home until I can take them with me."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time"; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers.	N,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she said, "Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he has younger legs than I have."	N,Su-
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ribby settled Duchess in an armchair before the fire, and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After the branches were lopped off, the trunks looked so slender and bare, that they could scarcely be recognized.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Accordingly, when he had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and looked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found.	D,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the land from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheelbarrow, which looked very much like mine.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then Simpkin went on tip-toe and took a little parcel of silk out of the tea-pot; and looked at it in the moonlight; and he felt quite ashamed of his badness compared with those good little mice!	D,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I must look out, that I may not miss the opportunity.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The pine-forests looked like little groups of moss on high rocks, whose summits were lost in clouds of mist.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	No one knew that, so the fox said: "I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The beer ran into the jug and Catherine stood looking on.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She had not been there long before she heard that the king"s eldest son was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows and looked out.	Su+,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Do not look at the lightning when the cloud bursts; even men cannot do that.	F,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when he had said that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery eyes.	A,N

looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Time passed on, and the young storks grew so large that they could stand upright in the nest and look about them.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with the hook--hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked very jovial, did little work, and had the more holidays.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The tailor was looking at the beauty with beating heart, when she suddenly opened her eyes, and started up at the sight of him in joyful terror.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She certainly might have asked more sensible questions; but if she had not been allowed to say just what she liked, would her daughter have been there, leaning so gracefully on her shoulder, and looking straight before her, with a smile that was almost mournful on her face?	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	No, I only wish I could get to the edge of the well, and look out; it must be beautiful up there."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked around on every side and exclaimed, "Oh, heavens, where am I?"	Su-,Su-
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The eight little pigs had very fine appetites--"Yus, yus, yus! they eat and indeed they DO eat!" said Aunt Pettitoes, looking at her family with pride.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I mention no names, but there is a hen here who intends to pluck herself in order to look well.	D,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he called his daughter and the children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two bright stars in its head.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So they looked up, and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal, and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.	A,A
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The servants now came in to look after the dead emperor; when, lo! there he stood, and, to their astonishment, said, "Good morning."	Su+,Su+
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Each wanted to be first at drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home.	F,F
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The metallic groups of figures, among which were Perseus and the Rape of the Sabines, looked like living persons, and cries of terror sounded from them all across the noble square.	N,F
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was?	Su-,F
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But when we succeeded in bringing him home, and prevailed upon him to open the book with the dried-up plants in it, he would sometimes sit for a whole day looking at this or that plant, while frequently the tears rolled over his cheeks.	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Look, yonder is an old wooden shoe sailing along," said one of the younger girls.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pigling Bland jumped, and looked round.	Su+,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The many delicate forms concealed in summer by luxuriant foliage, were now clearly defined, and looked like glittering lace-work.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They stopped when they heard the call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their fighting, which now became more furious.	A,A
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It produced the feeling which we experience when we enter a vault at a funeral, on a summer's day; while the hills and the clouds put on that singular green hue which we often notice in old paintings, and look upon as unnatural until we have ourselves seen nature's coloring in the south.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It looked like a whole town of naked wild men.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"You look well," said the woman; "you're fat and plump; you are well off."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I feel quite giddy when I look at him."	H,F
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The mayor pressed forward and said: "I will go down first, and look about me, and if things promise well I"ll call you."	Su+,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But they did not know her, and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel, taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop"s old enemy the queen; and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the glass and said:	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had forgotten me, and even had we met he would not have known me, for I have lost all my good looks, and perhaps that is all for the best."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Prince! prince! look again for thy bride, For she"s not the true one that sits by thy side."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At the back, large palm-trees were growing; and the sunlight made the leaves- look quite glossy; and beneath them what a profusion of luxuriant green, and of flowers red like flame, yellow as amber, or white as new-fallen snow!	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was not long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else but looking at the lady"s eyes, and doing everything that she wished.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It seemed as though the sound came from a church, deep in the calm, fragrant wood, and thither people looked with devout feelings.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At the second note the hangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and all the people who had followed to look on.	A,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the man went out and looked at the bird.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But wait a moment; it just comes into my mind, I require somebody to look after my pigs, for I have a great many."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There he sat one day, and held his magnifying-glass to his eye, and looked at a drop of water that had been taken out of a puddle by the ditch.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"That is not a fault," said the music-master, "it is quite perfect to my taste," so then it had to sing alone, and was as successful as the real bird; besides, it was so much prettier to look at, for it sparkled like bracelets and breast-pins.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The earth was soon left far below, and looked, with its mountains and woods, like a cornfield where the plough had made furrows which separated green meadows; soon it looked only like a map with indistinct lines upon it; and at last it entirely disappeared in mist and clouds.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of sheep and looking quite contented.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the play at the little theatre began, the rest sat and looked on; they were requested to applaud and stamp, or crack, when they felt gratified with what they saw.	H,F
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	You will reach a village in the evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you to be very poor and mean."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The pigeon-mothers said to their young ones: "Stand in groups, stand in groups! for that looks much better."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Little boys and girls fell over their own toes into the gutter, old women dispensed digs with their elbows, and looked sour, and took snuff.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to look at it, and he thought to himself, "It is a pity to ride upon this beautiful road"; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of it.	N,Su+
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very comfortable.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an end."	F,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She looked around her at the dark night.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I blew up the fire in the coals on the hearth, and it threw a red glow on his ghastly white face, lighting it up with a glare, while his sunken eyes looked out wildly from their cavernous depths, and appeared to grow larger and more prominent, as if they would burst from their sockets.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The mother loved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked at the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in the way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could get the whole of the property for her.	A,A

looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	What the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked around at the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then should he find out which was his Jorinda?	F,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when one looked at the fields, how beautifully the corn stood and how green it shone, without comparison! and there was a twittering and a fluttering of all the little birds, as if the day were a great festival; and so it was, for it was Sunday.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I wonder why grandmother looks at the withered flower in the old book that way?	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	OF course you know what is meant by a magnifying glass- one of those round spectacle-glasses that make everything look a hundred times bigger than it is?	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The goblin had the same wish; for, with one spring, he was up stairs and in the student's room, whom he found standing by the open window, and looking quite calmly at the fire, which was raging at the house of a neighbor opposite.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She looked up to heaven with all the purity and love of her young spirit, in all the expression of the highest and purest love."	N,N

looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The servants unpacked splendid garments, and washed him and dressed him, and when that was done, no King could have looked more handsome.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"People say that I look exceedingly well," said the flax, "and that I am so fine and long that I shall make a beautiful piece of linen.	H,N

looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One of the Frankish gentlemen made me stand in front of a rock, and drew us both as we stood there, so that we looked like one creature.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Oh, stay, stay!" implored the mother; "only one moment more; only once more, that I may look upon thee, and kiss thee, and press thee to my heart."	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The dog disappeared instantly, and before the soldier could even look round, he returned with the princess.	Su+,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ida looked that way, and saw a slight carnival rod jumping down among the flowers as if it belonged to them; it was, however, very smooth and neat, and a little wax doll with a broad brimmed hat on her head, like the one worn by the lawyer, sat upon it.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	This chamber looked upon the street, in which hung skins to dry, and there were thick iron bars across his window.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the child opened his eyes and looked into the glorious happy face of the angel, and at the same moment they found themselves in that heavenly home where all is happiness and joy.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: "That will be a dainty mouthful!"	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"The church bell hangs high, and looks far around, and sees the birds around it, and understands their language.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	On seeing the sparrow which the boys had brought, and which they said they did not want, he asked, "Shall we make it look very pretty?"	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She looked at the red shoes, saying to herself that there was no sin in doing that; she put the red shoes on, thinking there was no harm in that either; and then she went to the ball; and commenced to dance.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Hold," thought she; and then she turned round a second time to look at the moon.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And as he gazed on the uppermost lion, he thought of King Canute, who chained great England to Denmark's throne; and he looked at the second lion, and thought of Waldemar, who untied Denmark and conquered the Vandals.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when they had gone a very long way they came at last to a little house, and the girl looked in; and as it was empty, she thought, "We can stay here and live."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little tailor looked round and thought: "It is much more spacious here than in my workshop."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Prince! prince! look again for thy bride, For she"s not the true one that sits by thy side."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it as usual:	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was not so, however; there was a being standing before his bed, and looking like the ghost of his deceased wife.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched-looking houses, and Ib asked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted; she looked up timidly at him, and began to cry bitterly.	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was now a golden top, and whirled and danced about till he hummed quite loud, and was something worth looking at; but one day he leaped too high, and then he, also, was gone.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But there was not much kernel to be seen; it was what we should call hollow or worm-eaten, and looked as if it had been filled with tobacco or rich black earth.	Su-,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I am contented with anything," replied the husband, "so far as I am concerned, bread and cheese will do," and looked at the peasant and said: "Come and eat some more with me."	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	With a sort of reverence the daisy looked up to the bird that could fly and sing, but it did not feel envious.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There he looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he could help himself.	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked through the loophole out upon the Odense-Au, when the bed of the water was yet broad, and the monks' meadow was still a lake.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There he stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking down upon everything else in the room.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. Alfred again spoke of Italy, and of the glorious colors in Italian scenery; the purple hills, the deep blue of the Mediterranean, the azure of southern skies, whose brightness and glory could only be surpassed in the north by the deep-blue eyes of a maiden; and he said this with a peculiar intonation; but she who should have understood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it, which also was charming.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, "You must be well off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work."	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the shoe, that her white stockings were quite red.	N,Su-
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was dressed as a sailor, and looked small enough to be a middy, but he was not one.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The two cats ran to look at the dough pan.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The boar, however, had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, "Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame."	A,Su+
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There they both sat like a king and queen under the sweet-smelling tree, which looked exactly like an elder-tree, and he told his wife the story of the elder-tree mother as it had been told him when he was a little boy.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The thick-headed roses ought to know why, but they know nothing at all; they only look at themselves and smell.	D,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But after looking at him more closely, he thought he had been civil enough, so he placed him on the floor, and opened the chest.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very fast, and looking all around.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant called the cow-herd in and said: "Look, I have a little calf there, but it is still small and has to be carried."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He admitted that the pigeons, large and white and shining like mother-o'-pearl, looked like a kind of weather-cock; but they were fat and stupid, and all their thoughts and endeavours were directed to filling themselves with food, and besides, they were tiresome things to converse with.	A,A
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Really," he said, turning to the weavers, "your cloth has our most gracious approval;" and nodding contentedly he looked at the empty loom, for he did not like to say that he saw nothing.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I was sewn together by a young lady, and I have a Spanish cork in my body; but no one would think it, to look at me now.	N,N

looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The maiden looked for strawberries outside, but as she found none, she went angrily home.	A,A
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was lovely thus to look at the sunshine of heaven.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came in and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her, "Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but every now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you the way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me free."

looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and green.	Sa,Sa

looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"What is the sea, and what does it look like?"	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Here she saw stem by stem, but she looked up also; the sun shone through the leaves, which were quite transparent; and she felt as a person would feel who steps suddenly into a great forest, where the sun looks in between the branches and leaves.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest, she put her finger to her lips and said: "Hush! hush! go away as quickly as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your two ears.	N,F
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The road led him up a mountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Yellow buttons!" said they: "let us have a look at them."	Su+,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then a man approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could see the gallows, the man said to him: "Look, there is the tree where seven men have married the ropemaker"s daughter, and are now learning how to fly.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The elder one, who was named Care, looked rather gloomy; she always goes about to perform her own business in person; for then she knows it is properly done.	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the Snow Man looked, and saw a bright polished thing with a brazen knob, and fire gleaming from the lower part of it.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But Marleen stood looking on, and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no need of salt.	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now he looks in upon us and sings.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Just then a large old carriage came by, and in it sat an old lady; she looked at the little girl, and taking pity on her, said to the clergyman, "Look here, if you will give me the little girl, I will take care of her."	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	On one side the finest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked dreary and buried in the snow.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when she was grown up, the king looked at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to his courtiers, "May I not marry my daughter?	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"No let it stay," said the other boy, "it looks so pretty".	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away.	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	With tearful eyes and mournful glances, the sorrowing daughters and the afflicted husband looked upon her who would not hear their words of comfort; and, indeed, what comforting words could they speak, when they were themselves so full of grief?	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"It must look very grand," thought he, "for my wife to have a sentry guarding her nest.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She gave her too the shape and the look of the Queen, only she could not make good the lost eye.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He wept at the thought, and then he played with the little, lively dog, and kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him to encourage him.	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the maiden looked at them and recognized her brothers, was glad and crept forth from beneath the bed.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: "That is what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below there," and they rolled the barrel down into the water.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So she went by herself into her chamber, and got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whoever tasted it was sure to die.	A,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bamboo cane stood by, looking stiff and proud: he was vain of his brass ferrule and silver top, and on the sofa lay two worked cushions, pretty but stupid.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Delightful indeed," cried a voice quite near to them; no one but the tin soldier saw that it came from a rag of the leather which hung in tatters; it had lost all its gilding, and looked like wet earth, but it had an opinion, and it spoke it thus:-	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Here it's agreeable in winter!" said the little girl, and all the trees were covered with hoar-frost, so that they looked like white coral.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ha!" thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through the window, "after all I cannot prevent the sun rising."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah, father," said Hansel, "I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Sometimes he came to one of the windows and looked out; then the little boy nodded to him, and the old man nodded back again, till they became acquainted, and were friends, although they had never spoken to each other; but that was of no consequence.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They even fetched a candle and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked how much meal was left in the chest, and seemed dissatisfied--"You'll likely be moving on again?" said he to Pigling Bland.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The Mouse thinks she is looking very ill.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Thousands of tapers were burning upon the green branches, and colored pictures, like those she had seen in the show-windows, looked down upon it all.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Look! look! his leg is longer than mine!	A,Su-
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then, as the young lads often do, he looked out for the elder girls.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She looked at Aphtanides with a sweet but mournful expression on her face.	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The mother and son were walking in the churchyard when they discovered the old bell, and they stood still to look at it.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She entered the churchyard, and stood by the little grave, which looked like a large nosegay of fragrant flowers.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All the bells were ringing, and all the people went to church, looking cheerful, and dressed in their best clothes.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When any one takes one of these and holds it to his eye, and looks at a drop of water from the pond yonder, he sees above a thousand wonderful creatures that are otherwise never discerned in the water.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Look what is sticking to the ugly old fir-tree," said the child, treading on the branches till they crackled under his boots.	D,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I shall endure it, however, for I shall look upon it all as a mere representation, a masquerade, a mummery, which to-morrow, that is, when I myself as a journeyman, shall have served my time, will vanish, and I shall go my way, and all that has passed will be nothing to me.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer.	F,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he had done that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a hideous man was sitting in his place.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The fox liked it also, but looked about everywhere, and often ran to the hole by which they had come in, and tried if his body was still thin enough to slip through it.	F,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears.	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Thus she went on and on, and journeyed till she came to the world"s end; then she came to the sun, but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, "I smell flesh and blood this way!" so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a little piece of wood, and said, "If you have not this little piece of wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain, and there your brothers live."	F,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"The old woman is right," said the robbers, and they ceased looking for the finger and sat down.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The king"s son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found.	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The counsellor now saw quite plainly a lamp, and a large building behind it; everything looked familiar and beautiful.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him, he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house.	Su-,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out "isn't mouse" and changed it to "I hope it will be fine," and she gave her letter to the postman.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They look much prettier for it, and so did the flax.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Kaela looked like a doll in a doll's house, for everything was bright and new, and so fine.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say kindly to him, "My son, will you have an apple?" but she gave him a wicked look.	A,A
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked smart, for his shirt-frill, in which he had stuck a breast-pin, and his ruffles, were very fine.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She looked up, and by her side stood a man wrapped in a black cloak, with a hood closely drawn over his face; but her keen glance could distinguish the face under the hood.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She was lying on the dog's back asleep, and looked so lovely, that every one who saw her would know she was a real princess.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a cage on the wall.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Yes," said the smith, and looked at him, and thought, "That is a strong fellow who will strike out well, and earn his bread."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"White walls, and I am black myself," said the darning-needle, "that looks well; now I can be seen, but I hope I shall not be sea-sick, or I shall break again."	N,F
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, "Ah, wife! what a fine thing it is to be king!	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Yet he who wrote all this has looked at me, as every word flowed from his pen upon my surface.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Let me look at the egg.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant who stood in front of it.	Su-,Su-
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I promise you I will not say it any more," said the other; but as soon as people came by, nodding to him, and wishing him "Good day," he became so pleased, and thought how grand it looked to have five horses ploughing in his field, that he cried out again, "Gee-up, all my horses!"	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And that is the life drama that passes before the old maid while she looks out upon the rampart, the green, sunny rampart, where the children, with their red cheeks and bare shoeless feet, are rejoicing merrily, like the other free little birds.	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the sun set, the clouds were as red as fire; it became quiet in the wood; he sank down on his knees, sang an evening hymn and said: "I shall never find what I am looking for!	D,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It looked like a pale, rayless surface, and a deadly weight seemed to hang upon her limbs.	N,F
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And Mr. Drake Puddle-duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"There goes the old washerwoman up the lane," said the mother, as she looked out of the window; "the poor woman can hardly drag herself along, and now she had to drag a pail of water from the well.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was dirty and ugly, half-frozen and half-starved; he always looked as if he never had enough to eat, which was really the case.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and turned to run away.	F,F
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name was, and that she was a king"s daughter.	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought their lamps to look at her, and said, "Good heavens! what a lovely child she is!"	Su+,Su+
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser, and looked suspiciously at the tea-cups.	Su-,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the King looked kindly at her, stretched out his hand, and said, "Will you go with me to my palace and be my dear wife?"	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah, you have good reason to sing," said the bottle neck, which was looked upon as something very remarkable, because it had been in a balloon; nothing further was known of its history.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I can endure it no longer," said he; "how beautiful it looks when it stretches out its tongue?"	A,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But that does not disturb us, we quietly go on in our own way among the rest, whose ideas are certainly not ours; for we look at the bright side of things, and only speak what is good, although that is sometimes very difficult to find where none exists.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The top, also, was no longer young; but there came a day when he looked handsomer than ever; for he was gilded all over.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Where have you looked for him?"	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the two wings were eaten, she went and looked for her master, and did not see him.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Look at her!	Su+,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The fox's skin, the honorable sign of the furrier, was found fastened to the bell-pull of a young man who always went to early lecture, and looked like a furled umbrella.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The elder children broke off the flowers with long stems, bent the stalks one round the other, to form links, and made first a chain for the neck, then one to go across the shoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a wreath to wear round the head, so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands of green stems and golden flowers.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All his attendants, who were with him, looked and looked, and although they could not see anything more than the others, they said, like the emperor, "It is very beautiful."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The yellow centre in the daisy did indeed look like gold, while the little petals shone as brightly as silver.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Their lives and their deeds, looked at after my own fashion, I write down in my diary, as every one ought to do.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All this was very delightful, and when the beetle woke up he crept forth and looked around him.	N,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the ring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father"s and mother"s, and said, "O that our little sister would but come! then we should be free."	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The king looked at her and did not know her, but as they were such handsome fellows, he said: "Yes," and that he would willingly take them, and now they were the king"s twelve huntsmen.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So she did as the old woman told her, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, "What makes you so sad?"	Su-,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He only looked at her and they both remained silent.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Look!" said Care; "what happiness have your goloshes brought to mankind?"	D,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One day he said to her: "Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow." the woman also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little- town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There came another man, who looked gloomy and wicked.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She looked at them, but she saw them not; for her thoughts were far away from the domestic hearth.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and wondered that no one was there.	Su-,Su+
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands, and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Why do the flowers look so faded to-day?" she asked again, and pointed to her nosegay, which was quite withered.	D,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he looked at the picture he had bought at the broker's, and his eyes sparkled brightly as he nodded at it, and said, "Ah, she could sing that tune."	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Do you hear? he answers 'Yes,' but he fears that we shall not like to look at him."	N,F
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity to put the leathern saddle upon it.	N,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then it was carried down stairs and taken into the courtyard so quickly, that it forgot to think of itself, and could only look about, there was so much to be seen.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There were large holes and long cracks, out of which grew grass and leaves, indeed the whole balcony, the courtyard, and the walls were so overgrown with green that they looked like a garden.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the maiden gave her the bunch, the Virgin looked into her eyes and said, "Hast thou not opened the thirteenth door also?"	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A second pig was drawn by the side of the first, and this looked a hundred times better; and the third attempt was so good, that everybody might know what it was meant to represent.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked at the dragons, heads likewise and said, "You too cannot help me now."	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now he looked dressed, and rode on.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then all the flowers opened, and out of each came a little lady or a tiny lord, all so pretty it was quite a pleasure to look at them.	N,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It had no idea how many eyes looked eagerly for it.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It made one shiver with cold to look at him.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He went to look for two foxhound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	How does the city look when you enter in at the gate?"	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	then he looked up and the last one had left off work.	Su+,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Look at her!" they all cried.	Su+,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After a while the weather cleared up a little, and the beetle was able to rub the water from his eyes, and look about him.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The old man who said this looked old enough to be the grandfather of all present in the room.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look for some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and there, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the floor.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they were looking for.	N,Su+
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"We know, we know," sang the sparrows; "we have looked in at the windows of the houses in the town, and we know what is done with them.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"They look exactly like my own goloshes," said one of the clerks, examining the unknown articles, as they stood by the side of his own.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	That is a house to be looked at, and not to be touched," said the Wind.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	What a strange feeling it is- surely we all know it- to look through old letters of our young days; a different life rises up out of the past, as it were, with all its hopes and sorrows.	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king"s soup, and toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring, and put it into the dish in which the soup was.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the old attendant nodded and looked very pleased, and then he carried the tin soldier into the house.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old walls of the castle.	Su-,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the youngest child in the room, a boy, with large, earnest eyes, mounted upon a chair behind the window curtains, and looked out into the yard, where the moon was pouring a flood of light on the old gravestone,- the stone that had always appeared to him so dull and flat, but which lay there now like a great leaf out of a book of history.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment.	F,F
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now came the question whether he could squeeze through the palings; he certainly had never tried, so he stood looking at them.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Like the old minister, he looked and looked but could see nothing, as there was nothing to be seen.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle, but could not find it.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After a time, all the cockchafers turned up their feelers, and said, "She has only two legs! how ugly that looks."	Su-,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"'But first we went to school to learn something,' she said, 'and then we were confirmed; we both wept on that day, but in the afternoon we went out hand in hand, and ascended the high round tower and looked out into the wide world right over Copenhagen and the sea; then we walked to Fredericksburg, where the king and the queen were sailing about in their magnificent boat on the canals.'	N,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Why, when grandmother's tears fall upon the rose, and she is looking at it, the rose revives, and fills the room with its fragrance; the walls vanish as in a mist, and all around her is the glorious green wood, where in summer the sunlight streams through thick foliage; and grandmother, why she is young again, a charming maiden, fresh as a rose, with round, rosy cheeks, fair, bright ringlets, and a figure pretty and graceful; but the eyes, those mild, saintly eyes, are the same,- they have been left to grandmother.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went close to the edge of the waves, and said:	F,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Look, I am lame, and have blisters on my feet with walking here, I cannot possibly turn back again.	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The king"s son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.	F,Su-
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the tree saw all the fresh bright flowers in the garden, and then looked at itself, and wished it had remained in the dark corner of the garret.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	How the street must have looked when the houses had all gable roofs, open staircases, and gutters with dragons at the spout.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It all looked very lovely, but the old lady could not see very well, and therefore did not get much pleasure out of it.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Strange merchants drive by her, and they look anxiously after their wagons laden with merchandise.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There they sat, all three; and as for Alfred, a proverb may describe his position- he looked like a swan amongst the geese.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Proudly and boldly he looked up, while the lightning flashed across the sky as if the whole world were in flames.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon it.	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The Toad thought it was a flower which had broken loose that it might look about better in the world, which was quite a natural thing to do.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They did not look ill at all now, but jumped about and were very merry, yet none of them noticed little Ida.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Karen looked first at the black shoes, then at the red ones- looked at the red ones again, and put them on.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Good night, my masters!" said he, "I"m off! mind and look sharp after me the next time."	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Still I wish this place were not so dark, as well as lonely, with not even a little hare to look at.	Sa,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Every one ran out to look at them. and a shoemaker's boy, with a leather apron and slippers on, galloped by so fast, that one of his slippers flew off and struck against the wall where the soldier sat looking through the iron grating.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But in front of the tan-yard, close to the entrance, stood a little girl clothed in rags, very pretty to look at, with curly hair, and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look into them.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It seemed too much for him to bear; and this happened not once, but many times; and at last one day he seized the delicate fingers and the white hand, and kissed it, and looked into her great brown eyes.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But instead of a book, it was a work of art contained in a casket, an artificial nightingale made to look like a living one, and covered all over with diamonds, rubies, and sapphires.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The tailor stood still, and looked at the seat for a long time, for it pleased him better than all else.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He is my own child, and he is not so very ugly after all if you look at him properly.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his third horse as he done the other two.	A,A
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He would sit and look at the wall from which the plaster had in some places fallen off, and fancy all sorts of scenes which had been in former times.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I do not know what occupation he pursues; he looks stout and comfortable.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they saw him they took him up and turned him over and over, looking very learned all the time, especially one, who was a boy.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Everybody looked at her feet, and the whole of the way from the church door to the choir it seemed to her as if even the ancient figures on the monuments, in their stiff collars and long black robes, had their eyes fixed on her red shoes.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The clerk turned and spoke to the man; but when he had done with him, he turned to look at the goloshes again, and now he was in greater doubt than ever as to whether the pair on the right or on the left belonged to him.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She drew nearer, she stopped to look at the hat; "Ha! what was lying yonder?"	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Everything invited to slumber, everything had a charming look of repose; and so the nurse had discovered, for she slept; and well she might sleep, while everything around her told of happiness and blessing.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in, looking like a king"s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little calf always remained standing like one which was eating, and the cow-herd said: "It will soon run by itself, just look how it eats already!"	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The old clerks of Hauschen Street very seldom met together; each one remained in his own booth, which was closed early enough in the evening, and then it looked dark and dismal out in the street.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ib looked at her, and as she spoke so kindly, he took courage, and asked her if she would give him the nuts; and the woman gave them to him, and then gathered some more from the bushes for herself, quite a pocket full.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	If they were only plucked a little they would look no better than the rest of us.	D,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She sat in the pew with the rest of the pastor's household, and when they had finished the hymn and looked up, they nodded and said, "It was right of you to come, Karen."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Look, do you see that large cauldron of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire!	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged like bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved one as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to your home.	N,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked a personification of fasting; but he carried his nose very high, for he was related to the "forty (k)nights," and was a weather prophet.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green is good for the eyes.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Those who sat near him, and heard what he said, looked at him in great astonishment, and one of them rose, took off his hat respectfully, and said in a very serious manner, "You must certainly be a very learned man, monsieur."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It only looks like something.	D,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Look out for the drumsticks," replied Peter; and, small as he was, he ran up boldly, and gave the foremost such a punch in the body with his fist, that the fellow lost his legs and tumbled over, and the others took their legs off with themselves very rapidly.	A,A
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the children, who were at play, came and seated themselves in front of the fire, and looked at it and cried, "Pop, pop."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	From the street could be seen the room in which the walls were covered with leather, ragged and torn, and the green in the balcony hung straggling over the beams; they pulled it down quickly, for it looked ready to fall, and at last it was cleared away altogether.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, "Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here," and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.	N,A
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Where would Joanna's place be on that wall some day? and how would he look,- her noble lord and husband?	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they wandered up the great ridge, and looked across the stream to the heath, where the little hills were covered with the flowering broom.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked at everything full of admiration, and was on the point of going out again, when he once more heard the voice which said to him, "Step on the stone which lies in the middle of the hall, and great good fortune awaits thee."	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked up, blinking, and saw an offensively ugly elderly man, grinning from ear to ear.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Just look at little Miss Glove, how she's pointing her fingers!	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the old woman heard that, she became quite friendly, and carried her over the water, gave her a wand, and said to her, "Go, my daughter, ever onwards by this road, and when you come to a great black dog, you must pass it silently and boldly, without either laughing or looking at it.	N,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Longman, the middle finger, looked over the heads of all the others.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When, therefore, she was led to the stake, she laid the shirts on her arm, and when she stood on high and the fire was just going to be lighted, she looked around and six swans came flying through the air towards her.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the miller had got up, he wanted to look after him, and wondered if he were still alive.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"God be with you," he cried again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went back to their fighting.	A,A
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	How pretty and bright she looked: even my mother's eyes were not more gentle than hers.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Suppose I were to go back now and say how ill I feel, I fear it would look so ridiculous, and it is not very likely that I should find any one up."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I can fancy what I should see in the whole row of ladies and gentlemen on the first seat, if I could only look into their hearts; that lady, I imagine, keeps a store for things of all descriptions; how my eyes would wander about in that collection; with many ladies I should no doubt find a large millinery establishment.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In their pride they did not see the little daisy, which looked over to them and thought, "How rich and beautiful they are!	H,Su+
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Oh, it is very pretty, exceedingly beautiful," replied the old minister looking through his glasses.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Meantime the master looked to see what the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps.	N,N
placing hands in one’s pockets	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Whenever he dozed, he dreamed that he had lost one or another of these possessions; then he would awake with a start, and the first movements of his hand formed a triangle from his right-hand pocket to his breast, and from his breast to his left-hand pocket, to feel whether they were all safe.	N,N
placing hands in one’s pockets	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The son said: "Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower," and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.	H,H
placing hands in one’s pockets	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered that each brick, when finished, brought him in a small coin, if only a copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one upon another, can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a person knocks, who has a number of these in his hands, whether it be the baker's, the butcher's, or the tailor's, the door flies open, and he can get all he wants.	Su+,N
placing hands in one’s pockets	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One of them drew a small pair of scissors from her pocket, and cut the worsted without hurting the beetle, and when she stepped on shore she placed him on the grass.	N,N
placing hands in one’s pockets	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise," "Well thrown," said the tailor, "but after all the stone came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come back at all," and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air.	H,N
wide eyes	[('PARANOIA', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('UNEASE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Ib and Christina looked at the wishing nuts with wide open eyes.	H,Su+
wide eyes	[('PARANOIA', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('UNEASE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Then he went to the innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: "I never expected to see you alive again!	Su+,N
wide eyes	[('PARANOIA', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('UNEASE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"Heaven preserve us!" he thought, and opened his eyes wide, "I cannot see anything at all," but he did not say so.	Su-,Su-
wide eyes	[('PARANOIA', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('UNEASE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"How did you get all this money?" asked Great Claus, staring with wide open eyes at his neighbor's treasures.	N,Su-
a need to sit down	[('AMUSEMENT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--"and I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched.	N,N
a need to sit down	[('AMUSEMENT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	And Holger Danske did dream of the little humble room in which the image-carver sat; he heard all that had been said, and he nodded in his dream, saying, "Ah, yes, remember me, you Danish people, keep me in your memory, I will come to you in the hour of need."	H,N
looking down to hide a grin	[('ELATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Our windows looked into the tan-yard, which was divided into two parts by a partition of planks; in one half were many skins and hides, raw and tanned.	N,N
looking down to hide a grin	[('ELATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Tommy Brock opened both eyes, and looked at the rope and grinned.	H,D
looking down to hide a grin	[('ELATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket.	N,N
looking down to hide a grin	[('ELATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	He looked up, blinking, and saw an offensively ugly elderly man, grinning from ear to ear.	H,N
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.	H,N
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	They are embracing each other, and one little one stretches out his hand towards another who stands below him, and points to himself, as if he were saying, "I am going to heaven."	H,N
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	He was to be taken to the country to be buried there in his own grave; so they carried him away; no one followed him, for all his friends were dead; and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as the hearse moved away with it.	Sa,N
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	But suddenly it seemed to her that there stood on the threshold a beautiful young form, as beautiful as the count's child, and this apparition said to her, "The world is passing away; hold fast to me, for you are my mother after all; you have an angel in heaven, hold me fast;" and the child-angel stretched out his hand and seized her.	N,N
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The window stood open the whole day, and the little elf could easily have reached the roses, or any of the flowers; but he could not find it in his heart to leave one so afflicted.	N,N
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it."	N,N
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	People came and went, mass was performed, but no one noticed the boy, excepting an elderly citizen, who stood still and looked at him for a moment, and then went away like the rest.	N,N
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.	Sa,Sa
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy.	Su-,H
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And now he had carved Holger Danske, who stood there erect and proud, with his long beard, holding in one hand his broad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the Danish arms.	N,N
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.	N,Su+
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	She had not a button- that she knew right well, and therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside, till all the others had seen the grave and had gone away; then she sat down, held her little brown hands before her eyes, and burst into tears; this girl alone had not seen Puggie's grave.	Sa,Sa
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"Ding-dong! ding-dong!" sounded the Bell, when the tower still stood there; and one evening, while the sun was setting, and the Bell was swinging away bravely, it broke loose and came flying down through the air, the brilliant metal shining in the ruddy beam.

standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"Ferry me across first," said the luck-child, "and then I will tell you how you can be set free," and when he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil"s advice: "Next time any one comes, who wants to be ferried over, just put the oar in his hand."

standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	One of the branches of the tree had, however, been broken: mischievous hands must have done this in passing, for the tree now stood in a public thoroughfare.	N,N
standing away and reaching in with one hand	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The one who stood first in the rank was named the thumb, he was short and thick, and had only one joint in his back, and could therefore make but one bow; but he said that if he were cut off from a man's hand, that man would be unfit for a soldier.

eyes that appear wet	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His hand moved quickly, and his eye measured the great picture; and though nothing appeared but a faint line, the figure of the Saviour was as clearly visible as in the colored picture.	N,N
eyes that appear wet	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He glanced, with a very critical eye, at all the flower-beds, and found that the flowers were seated quietly and demurely on their stalks, just as maidens should sit before they are engaged; but there was a great number of them, and it appeared as if his search would become very wearisome.	D,Sa
eyes that appear wet	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He slept and yet he did not sleep; and it appeared as if the old washerwoman looked at him with kind eyes and said, "It would be a great pity if you did not know your lesson to-morrow morning; you helped me, and now I will help you, and Providence will always keep those who help themselves;" and at the same time the book under Tuk's pillow began to move about.

eyes that appear wet	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the father fell into a rage and said: "Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes?	A,A
eyes that appear wet	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I blew up the fire in the coals on the hearth, and it threw a red glow on his ghastly white face, lighting it up with a glare, while his sunken eyes looked out wildly from their cavernous depths, and appeared to grow larger and more prominent, as if they would burst from their sockets.

eyes that appear wet	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Her graceful limbs appeared to move; dolphins sprang at her feet, and immortality shone from her eyes.	N,N
eyes that appear wet	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then before the eyes of little Tuk appeared a confusion of colors, red and green; but it cleared off, and he could distinguish a cliff close to the bay, the slopes of which were quite overgrown with verdure, and on its summit stood a fine old church with pointed towers.	N,N
eyes that appear wet	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the youngest child in the room, a boy, with large, earnest eyes, mounted upon a chair behind the window curtains, and looked out into the yard, where the moon was pouring a flood of light on the old gravestone,- the stone that had always appeared to him so dull and flat, but which lay there now like a great leaf out of a book of history.	N,N
eyes that appear wet	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before.	H,H
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Oh, how they rushed upon it, till the branches cracked, and had it not been fastened with the glistening star to the ceiling, it must have been thrown down.	N,N

staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The angel seized it: the, pearl glittered like a star with seven-fold radiance.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All the people, amongst them Karen too, streamed towards the castle, where the little princess, in fine white clothes, stood before the window and allowed herself to be stared at.	N,N

staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His staff had fallen out of his hand, and his eyes stared at the moon, about which his honest soul was wandering.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It is a noble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand the stars."	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The stars became visible in broad daylight, large and sparkling, like clear and gentle eyes.	N,N

staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate.	Sa,Sa
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Peter and Benjamin flattened their noses against the window, and stared into the dusk.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All the good stars of life had brought their gifts to the newly born; here sparkled health, wealth, fortune, and love; in short, there seemed to be everything for which man could wish on earth.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pigling stared at the off hind shoe of the grocer's horse which had picked up a stone.	N,N

staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They stared at each other, and when it became worse the bachelor spoke in Latin, in the hope of being better understood; but it was all useless.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another.	A,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then.	H,H
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The whole of nature was one large holy church, in which the trees and hovering clouds formed the pillars, the flowers and grass the woven velvet carpet, and heaven itself was the great cupola; up there the flame colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared, but millions of stars were lighted; diamond lamps were shining, and the king's son stretched his arms out towards heaven, towards the sea, and towards the wood.

staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They meant the stars, but they knew no better.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, "Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here," and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.

staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The one who stared so just now, and whom he calls the sun, is not my friend; I can feel that too."	F,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, "Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin."	Su-,Su-
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The men stared at him.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Here I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of precious stones.	N,H
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	These were the emperor's good and bad deeds, which stared him in the face now Death sat at his heart.	N,N

staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.	F,F
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"My stars!" said she, "what shall I do to keep Frederick from seeing all this slopping about?"	Su-,Su-

staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He no longer carried the sharp sword, but a beautiful green branch, full of roses; with this he touched the ceiling, which rose up very high, and where he had touched it there shone a golden star.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Not a single herdsman did we meet, not a solitary hut did we pass; everything appeared lonely and deserted- only a shooting star showed that in the heavens there was yet life.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ribby stared with amazement-- "Did you ever see the like! so there really WAS a patty-pan?	Su-,Su-
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the king made the most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden, like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a thousand furs was made.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The wedding festivities lasted a whole week, and the dogs sat at the table, and stared with all their eyes.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he called his daughter and the children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two bright stars in its head.	H,H
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One morning the wood-cutter went out sorrowfully to his work in the forest, and while he was cutting wood, suddenly there stood before him a tall and beautiful woman with a crown of shining stars on her head, who said to him, "I am the Virgin Mary, mother of the child Jesus.

staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The counsellor stared with astonishment as he beheld a most strange procession pass before him.	Su+,Su-
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He stood a long time musing on the bridge which crosses the Arno, and looking at the glittering stars, reflected in the water which flowed between him and the elegant marble bridge Della Trinita.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But he walked on undaunted, deeper and deeper into the wood, where the most wonderful flowers were growing; there were standing white star lilies with blood-red stamens, sky-blue tulips shining when the wind moved them; apple-trees covered with apples like large glittering soap bubbles: only think how resplendent these trees were in the sunshine!	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she felt for the little piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars.	Sa,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The student, for whom my wife washes, says that when we die we shall fly from one star to another.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Some one is dying," thought the little girl, for her old grandmother, the only one who had ever loved her, and who was now dead, had told her that when a star falls, a soul was going up to God.	Sa,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Thus she went on and on, and journeyed till she came to the world"s end; then she came to the sun, but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, "I smell flesh and blood this way!" so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a little piece of wood, and said, "If you have not this little piece of wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain, and there your brothers live."	F,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The stars twinkled; and the new moon, in the form of a crescent, was surrounded by the shadowy disc of the whole moon, and looked like a gray globe with a golden rim: it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes.	H,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I know not whether the clear, blue atmosphere gleamed with its own light, or if the radiance came from the stars; but we could distinguish quite plainly the outline of the mountains.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three dresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared her face and hands with soot.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A wonderful blaze of light streamed from one of the monuments in the left-side aisle, and a thousand moving stars seemed to form a glory round it; even the coat-of-arms on the tomb-stone shone, and a red ladder on a blue field gleamed like fire.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The woman stared at him and shook her head.	D,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The night is splendid in the gleam of the Northern Lights, and in the glitter of innumerable twinkling stars.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She had a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world with him.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Where are you going to?"--Pigling Bland stared at him vacantly.	N,N
infusing one’s speech with positive words	[('HAPPINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the music-master made a little speech, full of hard words, and declared that the bird was as good as ever; and, of course no one contradicted him.	N,N
crumpling sinking to the ground	[('TERROR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There was no air beside the hot burning sulphur flame, and there was no ground under their feet; they, the wicked ones, sank deeper and deeper, while eternal silence surrounded them!	N,N
crumpling sinking to the ground	[('TERROR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One morning he broke, and sunk down altogether; and, behold, where he had stood, something like a broomstick remained sticking up in the ground.	N,N
crumpling sinking to the ground	[('TERROR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They dance on the green rampart, just on the place where, according to the old story, the ground always sank in, and where a sportive, frolicsome child had been lured by means of flowers, toys and sweetmeats into an open grave ready dug for it, and which was afterwards closed over the child; and from that moment, the old story says, the ground gave way no longer, the mound remained firm and fast, and was quickly covered with the green turf.	F,N
crumpling sinking to the ground	[('TERROR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She was overpowered by them, and sank down and crept along for some distance on the ground.	N,N
agreeing then not following through	[('RELUCTANCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious for his company.	N,N
agreeing then not following through	[('RELUCTANCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	So the young man agreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.	N,H
dull eyes	[('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run out of his mouth.	Sa,N
dull eyes	[('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the youngest child in the room, a boy, with large, earnest eyes, mounted upon a chair behind the window curtains, and looked out into the yard, where the moon was pouring a flood of light on the old gravestone,- the stone that had always appeared to him so dull and flat, but which lay there now like a great leaf out of a book of history.	N,N
calling in sick	[('WORRY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, "Always be a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you."	N,Sa
hunched or rounded shoulders	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The elder children broke off the flowers with long stems, bent the stalks one round the other, to form links, and made first a chain for the neck, then one to go across the shoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a wreath to wear round the head, so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands of green stems and golden flowers.	N,N
hunched or rounded shoulders	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he laid hold of Little Claus round the body, and pushed him into the sack, which he took on his shoulders, saying, "Now I'm going to drown you in the river.	A,N
hunched or rounded shoulders	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the song: "Three tailors rode forth from the gate," as if carrying the tree were child"s play.	H,H
hunched or rounded shoulders	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The paper boat rocked up and down, and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not change; he looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket.	F,N
seeking reassurance from others	[('ANXIETY', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	They waited there for half a day, and the food still remained warm and smoking, and at length they were so hungry that they sat down and ate, and agreed with each other that they would stay and live in that castle, and that one of them, who should be chosen by casting lots, should remain in the house, and the two others seek the King"s daughters.	N,N
seeking reassurance from others	[('ANXIETY', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The others laughed, and said: "Seek one for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable for you."	Su-,N
pointing with an index finger	[('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The fingers then placed the point of the needle against the cook's slipper.	N,N
pointing with an index finger	[('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Sweet-tooth, his neighbor, dipped himself into sweet or sour, pointed to the sun and moon, and formed the letters when the fingers wrote.	N,N
pointing with an index finger	[('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Just look at little Miss Glove, how she's pointing her fingers!	N,N
avoiding conversations about the subject	[('ADORATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	There had been a great deal of talk on this subject while the basket was being packed, and during this conversation the eyes and the mouth of the furrier's daughter did not wear a very joyful expression.	Sa,Sa

a need to sit down and reflect	[('CONFLICTED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And Holger Danske did dream of the little humble room in which the image-carver sat; he heard all that had been said, and he nodded in his dream, saying, "Ah, yes, remember me, you Danish people, keep me in your memory, I will come to you in the hour of need."

hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Then we shall not meet," said the king's son, nodding to the poor boy, who went into the deepest part of the wood, where the thorns tore his shabby clothes and scratched his hands, face, and feet until they bled.	N,N

hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The following day the king"s daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it, she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it fast with both hands.	Su-,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The eldest thought: "I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a feather," and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.	Su-,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of her top drawer; then she set the boy"s head again on his shoulders, and bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Peter was obliged to take the tailor out of heaven again, and as he had torn shoes, and feet covered with blisters, he took a stick in his hand, and went to "Wait-a-bit," where the good soldiers sit and make merry.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the King looked kindly at her, stretched out his hand, and said, "Will you go with me to my palace and be my dear wife?"	H,N

hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care.	H,H
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king"s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her.	F,F
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it down, gave it into the tailor"s hand, and bade him eat.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I went up to him, and took his hand, and said, 'Do you still feel the same for me?' 'Yes; ever and always,' said he.	H,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then all the kings and queens of Denmark went up the ascent to the old church, hand in hand, with golden crowns on their heads, while the organ played and the fountains sent forth jets of water.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she sought for leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the roe; and every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for herself, and brought tender grass for the roe, who ate out of her hand, and was content and played round about her.	H,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Wait," said he, "I will warm you a little," and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man"s face, but he remained cold.	Su-,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was a fine moonlight evening; and when they arrived, Ib stood holding Christina's hand in his, as if he could not let her go.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the fur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the youth took the plough, and just pressed it with one hand, but his grasp was so strong that the plough went deep into the earth.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So she made the sister go and sit by the well and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She had not a button- that she knew right well, and therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside, till all the others had seen the grave and had gone away; then she sat down, held her little brown hands before her eyes, and burst into tears; this girl alone had not seen Puggie's grave.	Sa,Sa
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the lazy girl answered, "Do you think I am going to dirty my hands for you?" and walked on.	D,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and led the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib, hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest.	A,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the four brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went all out at the gate together.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	How the fire burned! and seemed so beautifully warm that the child stretched out her feet as if to warm them, when, lo! the flame of the match went out, the stove vanished, and she had only the remains of the half-burnt match in her hand.	Su-,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	'Will you, then, marry a maiden who honors and esteems you, although she cannot offer you her love? but that may come.' 'Yes, it will come,' said he; and we joined our hands together, and I went home to my mistress.	H,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and was eating it.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	This went on for the whole day, but at last by the evening the huntsmen had surrounded him, and one of them wounded him a little in the foot, so that he limped and ran slowly.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands, and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah! the fool," answered the devil; "when any one comes and wants to go across he must put the oar in his hand, and the other man will have to ferry and he will be free."	H,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away with it in her hand.	A,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the pendulum of the old clock went to and fro, and the hands turned round; and as time passed on, everything in the room grew older, but no one seemed to notice it.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he sought out the thickest iron bar in the smithy for himself, took it as a stick in his hand and went onwards.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He turned round and was going away, but she seized his hand and pressed it to her lips.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All went right: then the fox said, "When you come to the castle where the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and when you get it into your hand, ride away."	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Just then he came running in, and the sister again tied him with the cord of rushes, took it in her own hand, and went away with the King from the cottage.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven years.	N,Sa
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he seized the chest in his hand and lifted it up a little, as if he were going to throw it into the water.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when he came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as if she was going to beat the boy.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And he carved her a pair of wooden feet and some crutches, and taught her a psalm which is always sung by sinners; she kissed the hand that guided the axe, and went away over the heath.	H,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I kissed her hand, and wept bitter tears, and I wept still more when I went to my room, and threw myself on the bed.	Sa,Sa
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower, and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he found his Jorinda again.	Su+,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They walked about hand in hand, just as the old couple had done when they were little, but they did not go to the round tower nor to the Fredericksburg garden.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden saddle.	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten sacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: "Tomorrow morning before sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be wanting."	N,N
hands that go limp	[('DEFEAT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, "When you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry "Jip!""	N,N
closing the eyes and covering the mouth	[('ELATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	She was laid in a black coffin, looking mild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen, though her eyes were closed; but every wrinkle had vanished, her hair looked white and silvery, and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile.	H,N
wiping at the mouth	[('AMUSEMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	They are all over bristles," said Mr. Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat sleeve.	D,N
slipping hands into pockets	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Whenever he dozed, he dreamed that he had lost one or another of these possessions; then he would awake with a start, and the first movements of his hand formed a triangle from his right-hand pocket to his breast, and from his breast to his left-hand pocket, to feel whether they were all safe.	N,N
slipping hands into pockets	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"You have thriven well in the world hitherto," said the grinder, "now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand in it, your fortune would be made."	N,N
slipping hands into pockets	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under the stairs.	N,Su-
slipping hands into pockets	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"How can you ask?" said Hans; "I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there"s the goose."	H,H
slipping hands into pockets	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They slipped away hand in hand across an untidy field to the road.	N,N
slipping hands into pockets	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The son said: "Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower," and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.	H,H
slipping hands into pockets	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"However, there are quite enough left; I should very much like to examine these a little nearer, especially the moon, for that could not slip away under one's hands.	N,N
slipping hands into pockets	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Yes," said the other, "mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that beautiful goose?"	H,H
slipping hands into pockets	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise," "Well thrown," said the tailor, "but after all the stone came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come back at all," and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air.	H,N
slipping hands into pockets	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He put his cold hand in his pocket and felt his paper, he put his other hand in his other pocket and felt another paper--Alexander's!	Su+,N
slipping hands into pockets	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pigling fumbled in all his pockets, and handed up the papers.	N,N
slipping hands into pockets	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Is that all?" said the tailor, "that is child"s play with us!" and put his hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it.	H,Su+
slipping hands into pockets	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in his pocket and gave her what he had.	Sa,N
rubbing one’s arms and looking around	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said, "Prince, whither so fast?"	F,Su-
rubbing one’s arms and looking around	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When, therefore, she was led to the stake, she laid the shirts on her arm, and when she stood on high and the fire was just going to be lighted, she looked around and six swans came flying through the air towards her.	N,N
rolling one’s shoulders	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little ones twirled round like tops, and the large ones rolled away as far as they could, especially the one great silver crown piece who had often to go out into the world, and now he had his wish as well as all the rest of the money.	N,N
rolling one’s shoulders	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: "I have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger as I?	Sa,N
rolling one’s shoulders	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he had done it, he went into the forest, and pulled up two oak-trees, laid them across his shoulders, and hung on them one harrow behind and one before, and also one horse behind and one before, and carried all as if it had been a bundle of straw, to his parents" house.	N,N
rolling one’s shoulders	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She, however, caught at his cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to behold.	Su+,N
rolling one’s shoulders	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	While she was doing this kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down the hill.	N,N
rolling one’s shoulders	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The clerks pondered for a long time, but at last they said that no one was sure of his life with the head-servant, for he could kill a man as easily as a midge, and that the bailiff ought to make him get into the well and clean it, and when he was down below, they would roll up one of the mill-stones which was lying there, and throw it on his head; and then he would never return to daylight.	N,N
rolling one’s shoulders	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The elder children broke off the flowers with long stems, bent the stalks one round the other, to form links, and made first a chain for the neck, then one to go across the shoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a wreath to wear round the head, so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands of green stems and golden flowers.	N,N
rolling one’s shoulders	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.	H,H
rolling one’s shoulders	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas either rolled or stirred.	N,N
rolling one’s shoulders	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.	Sa,Sa
rolling one’s shoulders	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he had to sing a mass, and did not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his shoulders, and said it all in his ear.	H,N
rolling one’s shoulders	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One drop of blood, one single drop, came out of the white feathers of the angel's wings and fell upon the ship in which the prince sat, burnt into it, and weighed upon it like thousands of hundredweights, dragging it rapidly down to the earth again; the strong wings of the eagles gave way, the wind roared round the prince's head, and the clouds around- were they formed by the smoke rising up from the burnt cities?- took strange shapes, like crabs many, many miles long, which stretched their claws out after him, and rose up like enormous rocks, from which rolling masses dashed down, and became fire-spitting dragons.

opening one’s mouth to argue then stopping	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The one in the middle held a mussel in its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth"s feet, and when he had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.	N,N
opening one’s mouth to argue then stopping	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And when she opened her mouth, and was about to tell her mother what had happened to her in the wood, with every word she said, a toad sprang out of her mouth, so that every one was seized with horror of her.	Su-,F

waving people away	[('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Yes; one morning people came to clear out the garret, the boxes were packed away, and the tree was pulled out of the corner, and thrown roughly on the garret floor; then the servant dragged it out upon the staircase where the daylight shone.

making excuses to leave	[('DREAD', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The earth was soon left far below, and looked, with its mountains and woods, like a cornfield where the plough had made furrows which separated green meadows; soon it looked only like a map with indistinct lines upon it; and at last it entirely disappeared in mist and clouds.

making excuses to leave	[('DREAD', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he should thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and weather.

N,N
thinking about the time or future events	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The idea struck him that he should very much like to have such a pair of spectacles; for, if used rightly, they would perhaps enable him to see into the hearts of people, which he thought would be more interesting than to know what was going to happen next year; for future events would be sure to show themselves, but the hearts of people never.	N,N
rolling one’s shoulders and neck as if stiff	[('ANTICIPATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The elder children broke off the flowers with long stems, bent the stalks one round the other, to form links, and made first a chain for the neck, then one to go across the shoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a wreath to wear round the head, so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands of green stems and golden flowers.

asking for opinions or advice	[('CONFIDENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Ask the cat, he is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how he would like to swim about on the water, or to dive under it, for I will not speak of my own opinion; ask our mistress, the old woman- there is no one in the world more clever than she is.

keeping still	[('DREAD', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"Keep as still as a mouse," she said; "do not move or speak, or it will be all over with you.	N,N

keeping still	[('DREAD', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Indeed, she keeps her own carriage; but still she travelled by the mail, with the rest, because she wished to show that she was not high-minded.	N,N

N,N
thinking positive thoughts	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	And she looked at the red sun, and she thought about it so deeply, and thought of the little one whom the stork was to bring, and the wife of the drummer was very cheerful, and looked and looked, and wished that the child might have a gleam of sunshine given to it, so that it might at least become like one of the shining angels over the altar.	N,N
thinking positive thoughts	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then she rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had thought her dead long since.	H,H

thinking positive thoughts	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The little bird sang his own song merrily; in the street below there was driving and running to and fro, every one thought of his own affairs, or perhaps of nothing at all; but the bottle neck thought deeply.	H,H
thinking positive thoughts	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	And as he gazed on the uppermost lion, he thought of King Canute, who chained great England to Denmark's throne; and he looked at the second lion, and thought of Waldemar, who untied Denmark and conquered the Vandals.	N,N
thinking positive thoughts	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar, cut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the grasshopper for good.	H,N
opening and closing the mouth	[('CONFLICTED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She was laid in a black coffin, looking mild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen, though her eyes were closed; but every wrinkle had vanished, her hair looked white and silvery, and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile.	H,N
opening and closing the mouth	[('CONFLICTED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bright color has been changed by age to dark green; but clear, fresh water pours from the snout, which shines as if it had been polished, and so indeed it has, for hundreds of poor people and children seize it in their hands as they place their mouths close to the mouth of the animal, to drink.

finding somewhere to be alone	[('ANXIETY', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him alone on the wild rock, he said, "Alas! what roguery there is in the world!" and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to do.	Sa,Sa
finding somewhere to be alone	[('ANXIETY', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And when he awoke he found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger.	N,N
finding somewhere to be alone	[('ANXIETY', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"Oh!" answered she, "I used the butter to grease those poor trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on the road together somewhere."	N,H
finding somewhere to be alone	[('ANXIETY', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"I went alone through a forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:	N,N
keeping one’s back to a wall or corner	[('FEAR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"We must think of something else," said the king; "keep your shoes on when you go to bed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it."	F,N
rubbing at one’s lips	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One played the bassoon, the other the fiddle, and the third put the trumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly could.	N,N
rubbing at one’s lips	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And if one single word falls from thy lips, all thy work will be lost."	N,N
rubbing at one’s lips	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew which was the youngest.

enjoying listening to others	[('PEACEFULNESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The sparrows ate lustily; they listened attentively, and even stood in the ranks with the others, but it did not suit them at all.	N,Sa
enjoying listening to others	[('PEACEFULNESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	I was, as I have said, a boy, and only stood by and listened to what the others said; but it filled me with a strange emotion to listen to the old man, and to watch how the color rose in his cheeks as he spoke of the days of their courtship, of how beautiful she was, and how many little tricks he had been guilty of, that he might meet her.

asking too many questions	[('WORRY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, "I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask."

asking too many questions	[('WORRY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together."

asking too many questions	[('WORRY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The countryman stopped to ask what was o"clock; this led to further chat; and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and how all the world went gay and smiling with him.	H,H
asking too many questions	[('WORRY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pig- wig's gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland.	N,H
asking too many questions	[('WORRY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She certainly might have asked more sensible questions; but if she had not been allowed to say just what she liked, would her daughter have been there, leaning so gracefully on her shoulder, and looking straight before her, with a smile that was almost mournful on her face?	N,N
asking too many questions	[('WORRY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He asked several questions about the wood and about the exact position of the house and shed.	N,N

asking too many questions	[('WORRY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And so, on every summer day the dance was repeated, the same questions asked, and the same answers given.	N,N
asking too many questions	[('WORRY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he called one of his lords-in-waiting, who was so high-bred, that when any in an inferior rank to himself spoke to him, or asked him a question, he would answer, "Pooh," which means nothing.	D,N
a gleam in one’s eye an inner light	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A wonderful blaze of light streamed from one of the monuments in the left-side aisle, and a thousand moving stars seemed to form a glory round it; even the coat-of-arms on the tomb-stone shone, and a red ladder on a blue field gleamed like fire.	N,N
laying the blame on others	[('DEFEAT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said--	N,N
laying the blame on others	[('DEFEAT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	So he picked up the leaves and laid one of them on the mouth of his dead wife, and the two others on her eyes.	N,N
laying the blame on others	[('DEFEAT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Then she saw a large purple crocus jump into the middle of the table where the playthings stood, go up to the doll's bedstead and draw back the curtains; there lay the sick flowers, but they got up directly, and nodded to the others as a sign that they wished to dance with them.	H,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	By-and-by the boy was put to bed, in the same bed as the one in which his mother lay; but he slept at her feet, covered with an old quilt made of blue and white patchwork.	N,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The one in the middle held a mussel in its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth"s feet, and when he had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.	N,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Yes, I will go with you," said Tiny; and she seated herself on the bird's back, with her feet on his outstretched wings, and tied her girdle to one of his strongest feathers.	H,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.	H,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Once, however, when the King had gone out, and no one else was present, the wicked woman seized the Queen by the head, and her daughter seized her by the feet, and they lifted her out of the bed, and threw her out of the window into the stream which flowed by.	N,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They had little ones, and of course each one thought his own the handsomest and cleverest; one flew this way, another that, and when they met they recognised each other by their "Peep!" and the three scrapes with the left foot.	N,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The snow creaked under one's feet, as if one had new boots on.	N,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said, "No, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, I might very soon go begging myself.	D,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when he came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it, he stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to himself, "What a pity it is that anything should tread here!"	N,Su+
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There was no air beside the hot burning sulphur flame, and there was no ground under their feet; they, the wicked ones, sank deeper and deeper, while eternal silence surrounded them!	N,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the dogs fell upon the judges and all the councillors; seized one by the legs, and another by the nose, and tossed them many feet high in the air, so that they fell down and were dashed to pieces.	N,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was to be one "Peep!" and three scratches on the ground with the left foot.	N,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut off his head and feet.	Sa,Sa
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But to-day two old sparrows and a young one answered with a "peep" and the thrice-repeated scrape with the left foot.	N,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"No one ever places it in a nosegay; it is often trodden under foot, there are so many of them; and when they run to seed, they have flowers like wool, which fly away in little pieces over the roads, and cling to the dresses of the people.	D,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and led the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib, hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest.	A,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The old bell was, after a time, carried away to a greater distance than any one, even the warder in the bell tower, ever imagined; and the bell in the breast of the young man was heard in countries where his feet had never wandered.	N,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	This went on for the whole day, but at last by the evening the huntsmen had surrounded him, and one of them wounded him a little in the foot, so that he limped and ran slowly.	N,N
shuffling one’s feet	[('DOUBT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As he went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight, trotting gaily along on a capital horse.	N,N
walking with wide steps	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Men have a firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about."	A,N
walking with wide steps	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She put on her many-league boots, in which she covered an hour"s walk at every step, and it was not long before she overtook them.	A,N
walking with wide steps	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas either rolled or stirred.	N,N
walking with wide steps	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"'But first we went to school to learn something,' she said, 'and then we were confirmed; we both wept on that day, but in the afternoon we went out hand in hand, and ascended the high round tower and looked out into the wide world right over Copenhagen and the sea; then we walked to Fredericksburg, where the king and the queen were sailing about in their magnificent boat on the canals.'	N,Sa
walking with wide steps	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about.	N,N
walking with wide steps	[('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her the spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters.	N,N
dark circles under one’s eyes	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little one, with its bright eyes and golden hair, had been welcomed joyously on that dark November day.	N,H
sighing heavily or with exaggeration	[('ANNOYANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah," sighed the woman heavily, "if I had but a child, as red as blood and as white as snow," and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted.	H,H
holding the knees and legs tightly together	[('INSECURITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	This made such a great noise that the woman came out, and when she saw the wolf she called the people, who hurried there, and beat him as long as their sticks would hold together, till with two lame legs, and howling loudly, he got back to the fox in the forest.	A,Sa
asking to talk	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have asked: "Where is my MOUSE?"	A,A
looking to others for backup	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.	N,N
looking to others for backup	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The hens and the chickens came, for where one runs the others run too; they clucked, and chirped, and looked at the cock, and were proud that he was of their kind.	H,H
looking to others for backup	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The elder-tree smelt strongly, and the setting sun illuminated the faces of the two old people, so that they looked quite rosy; the youngest of the grandchildren danced round them, and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening, for they were to have hot potatoes; and the elder mother nodded in the tree and cried 'Hooray' with the others."

looking to others for backup	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"There is a hen- nay, some say that there are two- who have plucked out all their feathers, in order not to look like the others, and to attract the attention of the cock.	N,N
looking to others for backup	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	We saw this from above; and looked at from above, how many a grief of our own and of others can make us smile!	N,N
looking to others for backup	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Have you looked behind the large cask?" said one of the others.	N,N
looking to others for backup	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All his attendants, who were with him, looked and looked, and although they could not see anything more than the others, they said, like the emperor, "It is very beautiful."	N,N
looking to others for backup	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Look out for the drumsticks," replied Peter; and, small as he was, he ran up boldly, and gave the foremost such a punch in the body with his fist, that the fellow lost his legs and tumbled over, and the others took their legs off with themselves very rapidly.	A,A
looking to others for backup	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Longman, the middle finger, looked over the heads of all the others.	N,N
thoughts that turn inward	[('REGRET', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	All the written letters became quite red in a moment, and all the words and thoughts turned to fire.	N,N
thoughts that turn inward	[('REGRET', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	He would draw the coverlet closer round him, pull his nightcap over his eyes, and try to turn his thoughts from trade, and from the labors of the day, to olden times.	N,N
short fast breaths	[('AGITATION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	But the poor boy with the wooden shoes was quite ashamed; he pulled at the short sleeves of his jacket, and said that he was afraid he could not walk so fast; besides, he was of opinion that the bell ought to be sought at the right, for there was all that was grand and magnificent.	Sa,F
short fast breaths	[('AGITATION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her short legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!	N,N
short fast breaths	[('AGITATION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay, fast asleep on a couch by the window.

muttering shaking the head	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Let me see him," said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, "It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy."	H,H
muttering shaking the head	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit, with the goose for the king"s dinner upon it; the butler finished his draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave the boy the box on his ear.

muttering shaking the head	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said, "No, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, I might very soon go begging myself.

heart giving out	[('FEAR', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	In fact, this memory of the soul is a fearful thing; every sin, every sinful thought it can bring back, and we may well ask how we are to give account of "every idle word" that may have been whispered in the heart or uttered with the lips.

heart giving out	[('FEAR', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the huntsman said, "Give the old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and no stripes": for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.

heart giving out	[('FEAR', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	His mother also told him how the chiming of that old bell had once filled her heart with joy and confidence, and that in the midst of the sweet tones her child had been given to her.	H,H
heart giving out	[('FEAR', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The poor man"s wife shook hands with him, and welcomed him, and said he was to make himself at home and put up with what they had got; they had not much to offer him, but what they had they would give him with all their hearts.	H,N

a gleam in one’s eye	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Tommy Brock, who had opened one eye--shut it hastily.	N,N
a gleam in one’s eye	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A wonderful blaze of light streamed from one of the monuments in the left-side aisle, and a thousand moving stars seemed to form a glory round it; even the coat-of-arms on the tomb-stone shone, and a red ladder on a blue field gleamed like fire.	N,N
a gleam in one’s eye	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another.	A,N
a gleam in one’s eye	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The stick was lifted high in the air, and swung up and down till it jingled again, and quite dazzled one's eyes when the sun shone on all its glory of gold, and silver, and brass.	N,N

a gleam in one’s eye	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	No one saw her as she walked, nor did she see any one; for her eyes were fixed upon the one object of her wanderings.	N,N
a gleam in one’s eye	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still far off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white feather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.

a gleam in one’s eye	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He snored peacefully and regularly; but one eye was not perfectly shut.	N,N
a gleam in one’s eye	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The king was sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants, wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly have been rid of him again.	A,Sa
a gleam in one’s eye	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.	Sa,Sa
a gleam in one’s eye	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Bring her the loveliest rose in the world; one which exhibits the purest and brightest love, and if it is brought to her before her eyes close, she will not die."	N,N
a gleam in one’s eye	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His eyes gleamed, and his hair gleamed too- there was no denying that!	N,N
a gleam in one’s eye	[('PRIDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little one, with its bright eyes and golden hair, had been welcomed joyously on that dark November day.	N,H
wishing it hadn’t happened	[('REGRET', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his coming back.	F,F
running hands through one’s hair	[('DISBELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"See," cried the youngest, "there is a new one;" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, "There is another swan come; a new one has arrived."	H,H
running hands through one’s hair	[('DISBELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.	H,N
running hands through one’s hair	[('DISBELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on.	F,N
running hands through one’s hair	[('DISBELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he ran after him with the knife still in his hand, crying: "Just one, just one," meaning that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both.	F,Sa
running hands through one’s hair	[('DISBELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And they ran towards each other and took one another's hand, in the great cathedral of nature and poesy, and above them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy spirits surrounded them, singing hallelujahs and rejoicing.	H,H
giving someone the thumbs-up	[('HAPPINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"No, I don"t know," replied the boy, "but someone was standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he would neither gave an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel, and threw him downstairs.	Su-,N
giving someone the thumbs-up	[('HAPPINESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, "All is not right; someone took hold of my gown."

trembling chin and lips	[('TERROR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"And so he spoke to you in that way, did he, my child?" said the washer-woman, and her lips trembled as she spoke.	Su-,N
leaning over with the hands on the knees	[('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	How full of meaning that glance had been, as she leaned over him, holding in hers the pale hand which he had no longer strength to raise!	N,N
leaning over with the hands on the knees	[('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Next he crept on his hands and knees through an overfilled butcher's shop; there was meat, nothing but meat, wherever he stepped; this was the heart of a rich, respectable man, whose name is doubtless in the directory.	N,N
leaning over with the hands on the knees	[('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, "Stop thief."	A,N
leaning over with the hands on the knees	[('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The others were either blind, or had withered legs, which obliged them to creep about on their hands and knees, or they had shrivelled arms and hands without fingers.	N,N
leaning over with the hands on the knees	[('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the counsellor leaned his head on his hand, drew a deep breath, and pondered over all the strange things that had happened to him.	N,N
leaning over with the hands on the knees	[('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now he had carved Holger Danske, who stood there erect and proud, with his long beard, holding in one hand his broad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the Danish arms.	N,N
excusing oneself and leaving	[('FRUSTRATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The youth, full of joy, set out homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king"s beautiful daughter, who had now no more excuses left to make.	H,H
spinning away	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the door there was a golden key, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning away very busily.	N,Su-
hands moving in jerks	[('AGITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His hand moved quickly, and his eye measured the great picture; and though nothing appeared but a faint line, the figure of the Saviour was as clearly visible as in the colored picture.	N,N
hands moving in jerks	[('AGITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot.	F,N
hands moving in jerks	[('AGITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was to be taken to the country to be buried there in his own grave; so they carried him away; no one followed him, for all his friends were dead; and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as the hearse moved away with it.	Sa,N
hands moving in jerks	[('AGITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy.	Su-,H
