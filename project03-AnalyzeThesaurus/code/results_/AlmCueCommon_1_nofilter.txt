A,N
moving away	[('REMORSE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	If I only knew how to manage to move away from this place,- I should so like to move.	Sa,N
moving away	[('REMORSE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	He was to be taken to the country to be buried there in his own grave; so they carried him away; no one followed him, for all his friends were dead; and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as the hearse moved away with it.	Sa,N
moving away	[('REMORSE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Immediately the severed parts joined themselves together, the snake moved, and became alive again, and both of them hastened away together.	N,N
moving away	[('REMORSE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The boar, however, had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, "Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame."	A,Su+
moving away	[('REMORSE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy.	Su-,H
clammy hands	[('FEAR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The mist was cold and damp, her hands and face were moist and clammy with horror, a heavy weight again seized her and clung to her, her mind became clear for thoughts that had never before been there.	N,F
clammy hands	[('FEAR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Fear came upon her as if a cold, clammy hand had been laid upon her heart, so that she almost fainted.	F,F
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"No; let them scream away as much as they like.	N,N
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others screamed out: "Keep away; for goodness" sake keep away!"	A,F
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Presently they heard the frightful scream again, and Christina said, "We shall get into trouble about that pig."	F,N
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the raven flew over her, screaming again as he flew.	N,N
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs; the children laughed and screamed, and tumbled over each other, in their efforts to catch him; but luckily he escaped.	A,F
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the misfortune which lay before her.	Sa,Sa
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then it was quiet for a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the chimney and fell before him.	F,N
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were there.	Su-,Su-

screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy"s father, "Your boy," cried she, "has been the cause of a great misfortune!	A,A
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Will you be quiet? or I'll break your screaming head;" and she swung about the fire-pot which she held in her hand, while the boy crouched to the earth and screamed.	A,F
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly.	Sa,F
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild tom-cat and screaming frightfully.	F,F
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The rushing of the water through the sluices, and the scream of the wild ducks, were almost the only signs of active life at Silkborg.	N,N
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But no screams.	N,N
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and when their parents again brought food they said: "We will not so much as touch one fly"s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been here and has insulted us!"	A,A
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When the fox felt the first string, he started so that he one leg, from pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs.	A,A
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and they took him prisoner and carried him before the king.	Su-,Su-
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously, each outdoing the other.	Sa,N
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard.	A,A
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The hounds were running off, flocks of wild fowl flew screaming over the barrows, while the bramble bushes twined round the old stones.	N,N
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When he had gone a hundred steps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him, and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills and feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if each wished to have it himself.

screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried: "You have invited a fine guest!"	A,A

screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter!	Su+,N
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Once when it flew screaming over his head Mr. Tod snapped at it, and barked.	A,N
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Scream as he might, it would not help him.	F,F
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	An owl with fiery eyes flew three times round them, and three times screamed:	F,N

screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	All besides was a scream, quite as unintelligible as the warbling of the canary-bird, excepting to the clerk, who being now a bird, could understand his comrades very well.	N,N
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.	Su+,Su-
screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood; it was an ugly cry, and it frightened the children; but before them, in the thickest part of the forest, grew the most beautiful blackberries, in wonderful quantities.

screaming	[('RAGE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DESPERATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The cries and screams of the savage horde and of the birds sounded through the air, and I joined in it also; for I sang 'Ding-dong! ding-dong!'	Sa,F
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the hard-hearted robbers felt pity, and their leader tore up the letter and wrote another, saying, that as soon as the boy came, he should be married at once to the King"s daughter.	Sa,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the boy was already so strong that he tore up a young tree out of the earth by the roots.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The words were not what he wished to say, so he tore up the page.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he left her by herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.	F,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Bush and herb shot upward, and some even tore themselves up by the roots to rise more quickly.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The other paid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time.	A,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	That was still not enough for the giant; he again suckled him for two years, and when he then went with him into the forest and said, "Now just tear up a proper stick for me," the boy tore up the strongest oak-tree from the earth, so that it split, and that was a mere trifle to him.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But after what he had seen, the goblin could no longer sit and listen quietly to the wisdom and understanding down stairs; so, as soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret, he took courage, for it seemed to him as if the rays of light were strong cables, drawing him up, and obliging him to go and peep through the keyhole; and, while there, a feeling of vastness came over him such as we experience by the ever-moving sea, when the storm breaks forth; and it brought tears into his eyes.	H,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I will break down the apple-tree, and tear it up by the roots; never more shall it blossom or bear fruit."	A,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It would be a sin to tear up a book like this.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Hold fast! hold fast!" the spectre would cry; and as Anne Lisbeth murmured these words to herself, the whole of her dream was suddenly recalled to her memory, when the mother had clung to her, and uttered these words, when, amid the crashing of worlds, her sleeve had been torn, and she had slipped from the grasp of her child, who wanted to hold her up in that terrible hour.	N,F
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"It is a lucky thing," said he, "that they did not tear up the tree on which I was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a squirrel; but we tailors are nimble."	Su+,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Here she sat down with her hymn-book, and as she was reading it with a pious mind, the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the church, and in tears she lifted up her face and said: "O God! help me!"	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven, with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague, the ugly heavy stone.	H,H
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The tears of her husband fell on her forehead, but she took no notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They tore up trees in their sore need, and defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow."	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.	Sa,Sa
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It could not move one of its leaves, but the fragrance of its delicate petals streamed forth, and was much stronger than such flowers usually have: the bird noticed it, although it was dying with thirst, and in its pain tore up the green blades of grass, but did not touch the flower.	N,N
tearing up	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was a leaf torn out of an old book, a book that ought not to have been torn up, for it was full of poetry.	N,N
quiet answers to questions	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Those are difficult questions," answered she, "but only be silent and quiet and pay attention to what the devil says when I pull out the three golden hairs."	N,N
being the first to speak	[('DETERMINATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in the dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good deal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his house was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company: however, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet had laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and they bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.	F,H
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The conversation on this topic was only interrupted for a moment by the arrival of a newspaper, which did not, however, contain much worth reading, and while it is still going on we will pay a visit to the ante-room, in which cloaks, sticks, and goloshes were carefully placed.	N,N
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property--and other people's--and depart at once.	F,N
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She ran down, set a jug, said: "God bless it for you, Gretel," and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.	H,H
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Lucie knocked-once-twice, and interrupted the song.	N,N
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mew!" interrupted Simpkin, and he scratched at the door.	N,N
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mind--" "Wee, wee, wee!" interrupted Alexander again.	N,N
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises--	Su-,Su-
interrupting	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	We have always had the reputation of being pious, so we will allow them to pick up the corn with us; they don't interrupt our talk, and they scrape so prettily when they bow."	N,N
criticism	[('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But from that time forward, the whole shop, from the cash box down to the pinewood logs, formed their opinions from that of the cask; and they all had such confidence in him, and treated him with so much respect, that when the huckster read the criticisms on theatricals and art of an evening, they fancied it must all come from the cask.	N,N
swearing	[('IRRITATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I have sworn it: my will must be done!"	A,N
swearing	[('IRRITATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, "I have sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word."	F,Sa
swearing	[('IRRITATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.	A,A
swearing	[('IRRITATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They had sworn brotherhood in their youth, and the most beautiful and virtuous maiden in the neighborhood was chosen to perform the act of consecration upon this bond of friendship.	N,N
swearing	[('IRRITATION', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"'O Glove, my own dear, Though it cost thee a tear, Thou must be mine, For Holger Danske has sworn it!'	H,N
covering the mouth	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Thereupon she related what had happened to her in the wood, but with every word she spoke, gold pieces fell from her mouth, until very soon the whole room was covered with them.	N,N
teeth chattering	[('DREAD', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Ah!" said the wife, "and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that my teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins," and she tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the corner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.	F,F
teeth chattering	[('DREAD', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And when at last he crept into bed, he would be so cold that his teeth chattered in his head.	N,Sa
teeth chattering	[('DREAD', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?" said the rat, chattering his teeth.	A,A
a shake of the head	[('DISBELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Let me see him," said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, "It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy."	H,H
a shake of the head	[('DISBELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said, "No, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, I might very soon go begging myself.	D,N
shame	[('DEFEAT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"For shame, it is natural" repeated all her ladies.	D,N
shame	[('DEFEAT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"For shame, pa," she said, "it is not artificial, it is natural!"	Su-,N
shame	[('DEFEAT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	But her mother said, "It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame": and off she went with her two daughters to the ball.	D,D
shame	[('DEFEAT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"Ah, be silent," said the hostess, "so many prying persons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again."	F,N
shame	[('DEFEAT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	But the boys went on singing and pointing at the storks, and mocking at them, excepting one of the boys whose name was Peter; he said it was a shame to make fun of animals, and would not join with them at all.	D,N
shame	[('DEFEAT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the procession he said: "For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you running across the fields after this young man?	A,A
shame	[('DEFEAT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!"	Sa,Sa
shame	[('DEFEAT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then Gretel called out to her master: "If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten the moment they are at their juiciest."	Sa,Sa
shame	[('DEFEAT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	But you have not forgotten the good boy who said it was a shame to laugh at animals: we will take him a little brother and sister too, because he was good.	N,N
shame	[('DEFEAT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"Five hens," it now ran, "have plucked out all their feathers to show which of them had grown leanest for love of the cock, and then they all pecked at each other till the blood ran down and they fell down dead, to the derision and shame of their family, and to the great loss of their owner."	N,N
shame	[('DEFEAT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	It must be done, for very shame; you are sure to be asked when you come back if you have seen everything, and will most likely be told that you've omitted to see what was best worth seeing of all.	D,D
shame	[('DEFEAT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	What a shame to take my horse, and give me only a dry cow!	D,Sa
going for a walk	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	There was once upon a time a rich King who had three daughters, who daily went to walk in the palace garden, and the King was a great lover of all kinds of fine trees, but there was one for which he had such an affection, that if anyone gathered an apple from it he wished him a hundred fathoms underground.	N,N
going for a walk	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	He travelled about a long time in search of it and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for fourteen days and still could not find a way out.	F,Sa
going for a walk	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we go along."	H,H
going for a walk	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Then the boy went on his way and walked for many days, and at last he came to a great piece of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing.	N,N
going for a walk	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.	N,N
going for a walk	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	She had become quite a lady; she had a comfortable home of her own in the town; and out of doors, when she went for a walk, she wore a bonnet; but she never walked out to see the laborer: that was too far from the town, and, indeed, she had nothing to go for, the boy now belonged to these laboring people.	N,N
gossiping	[('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.	N,H
gossiping	[('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One day he said to her: "Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow." the woman also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating.	N,N
gossiping	[('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks, and sit under a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her.	N,N
collapsing	[('RELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('AMAZEMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf"s belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.	Su-,F
a bent neck	[('DREAD', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In front of the little window, an old bent bird-cage hung in the sunshine, which had not even a proper water-glass, but instead of it the broken neck of a bottle, turned upside down, and a cork stuck in to make it hold the water with which it was filled.	N,N
folding the hands	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She folded her hands, and hid her face in the cotton curtains of the bed, and wept.	Sa,Sa
folding the hands	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He folded her hands and read a psalm over the dead woman.	N,N
folding the hands	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The delicate folded hands and the noble face glorified in death by the solemn, earnest look, which spoke of an entrance into a better world, were alone visible.	N,N
folding the hands	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	You were standing quietly, with your hands folded, and your father and mother were looking just as serious, when the door opened, and your little sister Maria, who is not two years old, was brought into the room.	N,N
folding the hands	[('IMPATIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The old grandfather wiped his eyes, for he had known King Frederick, with his silvery locks and his honest blue eyes, and had lived for him, and he folded his hands and remained for some time silent.	Sa,Sa
waving a hand	[('CONFUSION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, "Stop thief."	A,N
waving a hand	[('CONFUSION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy.	Su-,H
waving a hand	[('CONFUSION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The Danish and the Swedish flags wave, and Danes and Swedes say, "Good-day," and "Thank you" to each other, not with cannons, but with a friendly shake of the hand; and they exchange white bread and biscuits with each other, because foreign articles taste the best.	N,N
complaining	[('ANNOYANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.	A,A
complaining	[('ANNOYANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but "very snug;" which is not the way to carry on a retail business.	N,N
complaining	[('ANNOYANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she discovered in what state of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained of her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of her husband, who was nothing else but a tailor.	Sa,Su-
complaining	[('ANNOYANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Still, as it grew, it complained, "Oh! how I wish I were as tall as the other trees, then I would spread out my branches on every side, and my top would over-look the wide world.	Sa,N
complaining	[('ANNOYANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He complained bitterly about the scarcity of pheasants' eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of poaching them.	N,A
complaining	[('ANNOYANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last he went to the judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck.	A,A
complaining	[('ANNOYANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: "Why cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies?	A,Sa
complaining	[('ANNOYANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I dreamt of a ferry-man who complained that he must always ferry from one side to the other, and was never released.	N,N
complaining	[('ANNOYANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bird complained to the dog of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited.	A,A
forcing a laugh	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He next tried to get off his horse and make his way on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.	Su-,F
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But they did not know what endless misery he had brought upon other countries, nor did they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from the debris of the destroyed cities.	N,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The father sighed, and answered him: "You shall soon learn what it is to shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that."	A,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The daughter sighed very gently; and how much there may be in a sigh, or attributed to it!	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah," he sighed, "if I were only on the other side of the Alps now, it would be summer, and I should be able to get money on my letter of credit.	Sa,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah! wretch that I am!" sighed she; "why did I not marry King Grisly-beard?"	A,A
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The young man attributed a great deal of meaning to this sigh.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And in a few moments deep sighs were heard, as of children weeping.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah," sighed the woman heavily, "if I had but a child, as red as blood and as white as snow," and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted.	H,H
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	We complied, and she wrote; but in the midst of the "General War-" she struck fast, sighed deeply, and said, "I am only a woman!"	Su-,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Alas!" sighed she, "if any of my father"s court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!"	Sa,F
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I heard him sighing like a soul in despair; I heard him praying, and I noticed how he held his breath.	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Good gracious!" he sighed, "I must have a tendency to softening of the brain, and here it is so exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head."	Su-,Su-
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Yes, this is my fate," and he sighed deeply.	N,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But at each "pop," which was a deep sigh, the tree was thinking of a summer day in the forest; and of Christmas evening, and of "Humpty Dumpty," the only story it had ever heard or knew how to relate, till at last it was consumed.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ah! how often then it thought of those better days- of the times when in the fresh, green wood, it had poured forth rich wine; or, while rocked by the swelling waves, it had carried in its bosom a secret, a letter, a last parting sigh.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The lieutenant felt this very keenly, and therefore leaned his head against the window-frame, and sighed deeply.	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!" sighed she; "would that I had married King Grisly-beard!"	A,A
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Beautiful Italy!" sighed some of the guests.	N,H
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Tweet, tweet," sighed he, "what a dreadful snowstorm!" and then he became silent.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, "splash, splash," he went into the water without touching him, "Oh," sighed the duckling, "how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me."	H,H
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Yus, yus!" sighed Aunt Pettitoes.	D,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last he sighed, "but the student has no jam!"	A,Su-
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Oh dear, oh dear," sighed Little Claus in the sack, as he turned and twisted about; but he found he could not loosen the string with which it was tied.	F,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He bent his head mournfully, and sighed in deep sorrow, as an unquiet spirit might sigh.	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	No; their sighs and lamentations still sounded from above; and she had nearly forgotten them, for the sake of him who was dead.	N,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It makes me unhappy to think that I shall die, and leave this poor child," sighed she.	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed.	A,A
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah!" he sighed mournfully, as he gazed at the birds singing merrily, or hopping from branch to branch, "they are much better off than I. Flying is a glorious power.	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little mice also kept away after this, and the tree sighed, and said, "It was very pleasant when the merry little mice sat round me and listened while I talked.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A low sigh was heard.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I know very well where she is," sighed the top; "she is in the swallow's nest, and has married the swallow."	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he sighed and said, "Ah, if I were but that Bavarian peasant, who likewise had three wishes granted to him, and knew quite well what to do, and in the first place wished for a great deal of beer, and in the second for as much beer as he was able to drink, and in the third for a barrel of beer into the bargain."	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	What a dreadful place; I shall never see them again!" sighed Benjamin.	Sa,F
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Benjamin sighed with relief.	H,H
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"'O-h, o-h,' she sighed; for people can sigh like the moaning of the wind among the reeds and rushes.	Sa,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At two o"clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses; but even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, "I know he has fallen asleep."	Sa,A
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I am certainly all wrong," said he, with a sigh; and yet I only drank one glass of punch.	Su-,A
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Aunt Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows--	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Alas! how soon all that is good and beautiful passes away," sighed the elf.	Sa,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ah, yes," he sighed, "I know one, in which everything is solid, but a servant is there already, and that is the only thing against it.	N,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The maiden sighed and said, "My step-mother practises wicked arts; she is ill-disposed toward strangers."	Sa,N
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The pieces were placed in a fire under the copper, and they quickly blazed up brightly, while the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a pistol-shot.	Sa,Sa
sighing	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ugh!" sighed the daisy, "that is terrible; now they are done for."	Su-,Su-
sitting quietly	[('SOMBERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I sit here patiently and quietly.	N,N
sitting quietly	[('SOMBERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But after what he had seen, the goblin could no longer sit and listen quietly to the wisdom and understanding down stairs; so, as soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret, he took courage, for it seemed to him as if the rays of light were strong cables, drawing him up, and obliging him to go and peep through the keyhole; and, while there, a feeling of vastness came over him such as we experience by the ever-moving sea, when the storm breaks forth; and it brought tears into his eyes.	H,N
sitting quietly	[('SOMBERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was forced to sit down in a corner behind the door, and was to stay quietly and peaceably there, in order that the Lord, when he returned, might not observe him and be angry.	N,N
sitting quietly	[('SOMBERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He glanced, with a very critical eye, at all the flower-beds, and found that the flowers were seated quietly and demurely on their stalks, just as maidens should sit before they are engaged; but there was a great number of them, and it appeared as if his search would become very wearisome.	D,Sa
sitting quietly	[('SOMBERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a confidential conversation together.	H,N
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"You need have no anxiety for the morrow; and when you are old there is a pension for you."	N,N
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The kids said: "Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go away without any anxiety."	N,N
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness.	H,H
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: "What is to become of us?	Sa,Sa
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then their anxieties are dispelled; and at even they join in the dance at the feast given in the great hall at Borglum.	H,N
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	He thought of all the terror and anxiety which he had undergone, and felt thankful from his heart for the reality and comfort of modern times, which, with all their errors, were far better than those in which he so lately found himself.	H,N
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The anxiety I feel on this matter prevents me from enjoying myself in Switzerland.	Sa,F
anxiety	[('GUILT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then quite composedly, and as if he had not an anxiety in the world, he took some nuts out of his pocket, cracked them, and ate the kernels.	H,H
moaning	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They ride the shortest way, through the waving reeds, where the wind moans sadly.	N,N
moaning	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he would give him great riches.	A,N
moaning	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The gnats were buzzing about and stinging, while the miserabili, outside, moaned in their dreams.	N,N
moaning	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I blew the smoke and ashes into his face and beard; I moaned through the broken window-panes, and the yawning clefts in the walls; I blew into the chests and drawers belonging to his daughters, wherein lay the clothes that had become faded and threadbare, from being worn over and over again.	N,N
moaning	[('DESPERATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The wind moans very strangely here, both within and without.	N,N
making excuses	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('AGITATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Thereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-inlaw, and made all manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine.	F,N
making excuses	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('RELUCTANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('AGITATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The youth, full of joy, set out homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king"s beautiful daughter, who had now no more excuses left to make.	H,H
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Anne Lisbeth walked on, thinking of nothing at all, as people say, or rather her thoughts wandered, but not away from her, for thought is never absent from us, it only slumbers.	N,N
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they went away again, and the king said to the lion: "You have lied to me, they walk just like men."	Su-,A
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A sailor boy had flung his large cap over the bird, and a hand came underneath and caught the clerk by the back and wings so roughly, that he squeaked, and then cried out in his alarm, "You impudent rascal, I am a clerk in the police-office!" but it only sounded to the boy like "tweet, tweet;" so he tapped the bird on the beak, and walked away with him.	A,F
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then, as it was Sunday morning and the weather very fine, he said to himself, "A walk to Fredericksburg will do me good:" so away he went.	N,N
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the soldier now threw away all the silver money he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack with gold instead; and not only his pockets and his knapsack, but even his cap and boots, so that he could scarcely walk.	N,N
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest.	Sa,F
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He then walked away towards the Metal Pig, half knelt down, clasped it with his arms, and then put his mouth to the shining snout and drank deep draughts of the fresh water.	N,N
walking away	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('SKEPTICISM', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As she turned to walk away, much came into her mind that she had heard in her childhood: old superstitions of spectres by the sea-shore; of the ghosts of drowned but unburied people, whose corpses had been washed up on the desolate beach.	N,F
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he closed the lid, seated the dog upon it again, and walked into another chamber, And, sure enough, there sat the dog with eyes as big as mill-wheels.	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They disputed about it for a time, but as they were weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more.	A,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Suddenly a feeling of fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep, that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him.	Su-,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They closed their eyes and- and- Well, now the story is ended!	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And she drew the curtains close round the little bed, so that the sun might not shine in their eyes.	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then before the eyes of little Tuk appeared a confusion of colors, red and green; but it cleared off, and he could distinguish a cliff close to the bay, the slopes of which were quite overgrown with verdure, and on its summit stood a fine old church with pointed towers.	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Bring her the loveliest rose in the world; one which exhibits the purest and brightest love, and if it is brought to her before her eyes close, she will not die."	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It has been raised from only a little sprig of myrtle that you gave me on the day after my betrothal, and from which I was to make my own bridal bouquet when a year had passed: but that day never came; the eyes were closed which were to have been my light and joy through life.	Sa,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree-- there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.	F,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A pious, faithful soul closed her eyes for ever; she was the pastor's wife. ..."If any one shall find rest in the grave and mercy before our Lord you shall certainly do so," said the pastor.	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Several of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing, and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in keeping his countenance, but the smile on his lips faded away; for he caught sight of a pair of dark-blue eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady.	N,H
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At the nearest corner, a lamp hung before a picture of the Madonna; but the light it gave was almost useless, for he only perceived it when he came quite close and his eyes fell on the painted figures of the Mother and Child.	N,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A little spider, which he could however not see, busily and cheerfully spun its web above him, so that there should be a kind of little banner waving over the old man, when his eyes closed.	N,H
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill," said one of the lizards; "I have not been able to close my eyes for two nights on account of the noise; I might just as well have had the toothache, for that always keeps me awake."	A,A
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She was laid in a black coffin, looking mild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen, though her eyes were closed; but every wrinkle had vanished, her hair looked white and silvery, and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile.	H,N
closing the eyes	[('GRATITUDE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('OVERWHELMED', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But in front of the tan-yard, close to the entrance, stood a little girl clothed in rags, very pretty to look at, with curly hair, and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look into them.	H,N
blinking	[('SADNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('CURIOSITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked up, blinking, and saw an offensively ugly elderly man, grinning from ear to ear.	H,N
complimenting	[('GRATITUDE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Send in all the bills again to everybody `with compliments,'" replied Ginger.	N,N
confusion	[('WARINESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	But Gambling Hansel instantly began to play again, and there was such a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they themselves were saying.	N,N
confusion	[('WARINESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then before the eyes of little Tuk appeared a confusion of colors, red and green; but it cleared off, and he could distinguish a cliff close to the bay, the slopes of which were quite overgrown with verdure, and on its summit stood a fine old church with pointed towers.	N,N
confusion	[('WARINESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	It could only be used by one object at a time, which was a good thing, as a number speaking at once would have caused great confusion.	N,N
confusion	[('WARINESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"None of them are engaged yet," said their mother, and the beetle maidens tittered again, this time quite in confusion.	N,Su-
confusion	[('WARINESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Amidst all this confusion, the angel pointed to the pieces of a broken flower-pot, and to a lump of earth which had fallen out of it.	Sa,N
confusion	[('WARINESS', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the tea- table, so did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out the pie.	N,N
a headache	[('ANNOYANCE', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	But guessing was of very little use; it made his bark ache, and this pain is as bad for a slender fir-tree, as headache is for us.	N,N
gratitude	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	With pious gratitude the girl looked upon this glorious work of God, and bent down over one of the branches, that she might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume.	H,H
gratitude	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Pig- wig's gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland.	N,H
faintness	[('NERVOUSNESS', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	But as soon as she stepped into the cold water, a sudden faintness seized her; she clutched at the air convulsively with her hand, took one step forward, and fell.	N,N
faintness	[('NERVOUSNESS', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	As the axe cut through the stem, and divided the pith, the tree fell with a groan to the earth, conscious of pain and faintness, and forgetting all its anticipations of happiness, in sorrow at leaving its home in the forest.	Sa,Sa
raising the voice	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Little nightingale," cried the girl, raising her voice, "our most gracious emperor wishes you to sing before him."	N,N
raising the voice	[('IRRITATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she raised up her voice to it, and said, "Thou blowest through every tree and under every leaf--hast thou not seen my white dove?"	N,N
still hands and feet	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.	H,N
leaning forward	[('ADORATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EAGERNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	No one was in the street but himself; it belonged only to him, so he boldly seated himself on the pig's back, leaned forward so that his curly head could rest on the head of the animal, and, before he was aware, he fell asleep.	N,N
shaking out the hands	[('NERVOUSNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of them; but shake hands with the princess last.	N,N
laying a hand over the heart	[('ADORATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The flames of the burning house opposite illuminated him as he sat, both hands pressed tightly over his cap, in which the treasure lay; and then he found out what feelings really reigned in his heart, and knew exactly which way they tended.	N,N
jumping up and down	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat"s long tail standing straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped up into a tree.	F,Su-
jumping up and down	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.	N,N
jumping up and down	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, "All is not right; someone took hold of my gown."	F,F
jumping up and down	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he was very angry, and went without his supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell down on his head, and killed him on the spot.	A,A
jumping up and down	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up.	H,H
jumping up and down	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.	N,N
rushing blood	[('AMAZEMENT', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	"Ha," he cried, "the blood is rushing to my head, and I shall go mad.	A,Su-
rushing blood	[('AMAZEMENT', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	"Good gracious!" he sighed, "I must have a tendency to softening of the brain, and here it is so exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head."	Su-,Su-
rushing blood	[('AMAZEMENT', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	"Pop, pop," sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood.	Su-,N
aches and pains	[('DEPRESSION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	But guessing was of very little use; it made his bark ache, and this pain is as bad for a slender fir-tree, as headache is for us.	N,N
stepping back	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round.	A,A
stepping back	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest.	N,N
stepping back	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When it came to her turn to sing, she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she could not refuse.	Sa,N
stepping back	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Out of the thicket stepped a tall old woman, her face quite brown, and her hair of a deep shining black; the whites of her eyes glittered like a Moor's; on her back she carried a bundle, and in her hand a knotted stick.	Su-,N
stepping back	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She sprang to the door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and brought her back and said, "Fear me not!	F,N
stepping back	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	However, as he was afraid of this great man, he left go of the plough, stepped back and stood at one side of the piece of land.	F,N
making promises	[('CONFUSION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('DISAPPOINTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him the best place in the court that he could wish for.	H,N
making promises	[('CONFUSION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('DISAPPOINTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	She had made a vow to take no one as her lord and husband who did not promise to let himself be buried alive with her if she died first.	N,N
making promises	[('CONFUSION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('DISAPPOINTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third demand.	N,N
making promises	[('CONFUSION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('DISAPPOINTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	So he took a great stone which was lying there, and placed it in the basket, and when it was about half way up, his false brothers above cut the rope, so that the basket with the stone fell to the ground, and they thought that he was dead, and ran away with the three princesses, making them promise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them, and then they went to the King, and each demanded a princess in marriage.	N,N
making promises	[('CONFUSION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('DISAPPOINTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	At his going away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, "Take this ring, and put it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise never to make use of it to bring me hence to your father"s house."	N,N
making promises	[('CONFUSION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('DISAPPOINTMENT', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not likely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them promise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to tread on Partlet"s toes.	N,N
nodding slowly	[('CURIOSITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Its wings could sustain it no longer, and gently and slowly it glided down upon the soft waving blades of grass, nodded its little head as well as it could nod, and slept peacefully and sweetly.	N,H
nodding slowly	[('CURIOSITY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pigling nodded slowly.	N,N
blushing	[('ADORATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('GUILT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"The patty pan that held up the pie-crust," said Duchess, blushing under her black coat.	N,N
blushing	[('ADORATION', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('GUILT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A young maiden knelt at the altar, and renewed the vows made at her baptism; and there were white roses and red roses on the blushing cheeks of that young girl.	N,N
wandering thoughts	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Anne Lisbeth walked on, thinking of nothing at all, as people say, or rather her thoughts wandered, but not away from her, for thought is never absent from us, it only slumbers.	N,N
wandering thoughts	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	I thought of our cool mountain-home, and the fresh water that flowed near it; my mother, too, longed for if, and one evening we wandered towards home.	N,N
covering the face	[('TERROR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Nobody shed a tear over him; his face was covered over with a white cloth, under his head they had placed a large thick book, the leaves of which consisted of folded sheets of blotting-paper, and withered flowers lay between them; it was the herbarium which he had gathered in various places and was to be buried with him, according to his own wish.	N,N
covering the face	[('TERROR', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The cloth which covered his face was lifted up; the dead man's face expressed peace- a sunbeam fell upon it.	H,N
picking fights	[('SCORN', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('JEALOUSY', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat"s long tail standing straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped up into a tree.	F,Su-
small steps	[('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One of them drew a small pair of scissors from her pocket, and cut the worsted without hurting the beetle, and when she stepped on shore she placed him on the grass.	N,N

N,N
leaning back	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She had been sitting in her arm-chair, telling us a long, beautiful tale; and when it was finished, she said she was tired, and leaned her head back to sleep awhile.	N,N
leaning back	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	No one was in the street but himself; it belonged only to him, so he boldly seated himself on the pig's back, leaned forward so that his curly head could rest on the head of the animal, and, before he was aware, he fell asleep.	N,N
leaning back	[('DISGUST', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I lay on my back in the boat, Anastasia leaned against me, while the stars above us glittered more brightly than the lamps in our church.	N,N
restlessness	[('FRUSTRATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I must get higher yet; I feel a great restlessness and longing."	A,N
a trembling voice	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	He lifted it with a trembling hand, and exclaimed in a voice of agitation, 'Gold! gold!'	Su+,N
cold eyes	[('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Gladly would she have taken the body home with her; but that was impossible; so she took up the poor head with the closed eyes, kissed the cold lips, and shook the mould out of the beautiful hair.	N,N
cold eyes	[('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Death continued to stare at the emperor with his cold, hollow eyes, and the room was fearfully still.	N,N
cold eyes	[('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A cold wind swept over the pastor's head; he opened his eyes, and it seemed to him as if the moon was shining into his room.	N,N
waist	[('WARINESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	No; the little girl seized the boy round the waist, and then they flew far into the country.	N,N
waist	[('WARINESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Gold-band, the next finger, wore a golden circle round his waist.	N,N
waist	[('WARINESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Presently a large cockchafer flew by; the moment he caught sight of her, he seized her round her delicate waist with his claws, and flew with her into a tree.	Su-,N
waist	[('WARINESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	She picked up the soldier and held him by the waist between her finger and thumb, and carried him into the room.	N,N
waist	[('WARINESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	The elder children broke off the flowers with long stems, bent the stalks one round the other, to form links, and made first a chain for the neck, then one to go across the shoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a wreath to wear round the head, so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands of green stems and golden flowers.	N,N
waist	[('WARINESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"Her waist is quite slim.	D,N
hands that tremble	[('DREAD', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king"s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her.	F,F
hands that tremble	[('DREAD', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Gold! gold!' he shouted, again holding the glass aloft, that it might flash in the sunshine; but his hand trembled, and the alchymic glass fell from it, clattering to the ground, and brake in a thousand pieces.	H,N
silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Silence! silence!" said grandpapa.	N,N
silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Stern death, thy chilling silence waketh dread; Yet in thy darkest hour there may be light.	N,N
silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As Anne Lisbeth walked on she could hear her own footsteps in the sands; even the waves of the sea were at rest, and all in the deep waters had sunk into silence.	N,N
silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She stepped inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned throughout.	N,N
silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There was no air beside the hot burning sulphur flame, and there was no ground under their feet; they, the wicked ones, sank deeper and deeper, while eternal silence surrounded them!	N,N
silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The silence which reigned here expressed a world of grief.	N,Sa
silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The mass has long been finished, silence reigns in the church, and the wax is heard dropping from the candles to the stone pavement.	N,N
silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At this, too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always silenced her.	F,F
silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He remained for a time standing without moving, apparently with the idea of waiting for a favorable decision, but as I continued to keep silence, he angrily declared he would revenge himself and find means to punish my pride, and left the room.	N,N
silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His very silence now proves his affection."	N,N
silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they ceased, and all around became still; not a bird could be heard, they were all at rest, even the owl had not left her hiding place; deep silence reigned on the margin of the wood by the sea-shore.	N,N
silence	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"What have you done!" said her mother, "but no one must know about it, so you must keep silence; what is done can"t be undone; we will make him into puddings."	A,A
the desire to be alone	[('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then the forbidden door alone remained, and she felt a great desire to know what could be hidden behind it, and said to the angels, "I will not quite open it, and I will not go inside it, but I will unlock it so that we can just see a little through the opening."	N,N
grimacing	[('GUILT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('CONFUSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the people gave a cheer for the speech, but they shouted much louder for the Harlequin, when he appeared in front of the platform, and made a grimace at them.	N,N
grimacing	[('GUILT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('CONFUSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The young frogs listened and stared; and as these words did not please them, they made grimaces and dived down under the water.	D,N
showing off	[('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When Hans heard that, he left off beating him and the mannikin told him that he was an earth mannikin, and that there were more than a thousand like him, and that if he would go with him he would show him where the King"s daughters were.	N,N
showing off	[('JEALOUSY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth.

saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he told her all that had happened, and said, "I love you far better than all the world; so come with me to my father"s palace, and you shall be my wife."	H,N
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last she went to a fairy, and said, "I should so very much like to have a little child; can you tell me where I can find one?"	N,N
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the prince thought to himself, "I cannot go home to my father without my brothers"; so he said, "My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who set out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?"	N,Sa
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She was very pleased with Tiny, so she said, "You are quite welcome to stay with me all the winter, if you like; but you must keep my rooms clean and neat, and tell me stories, for I shall like to hear them very much."	H,H
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"How can you say so?" said she; "I am sure you never told me not."	Sa,Su-
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together."	F,F
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"With all my heart," said Hans: "but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one thing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you."	Su+,H
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: "I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening.	H,Sa
saying i told you so	[('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been, he knew his beloved wife"s voice, and sprang up, and said, "You have awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour."	H,H
illness	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They lived now for a while happy and contented with each other, and then it befell that the young Queen was attacked by a severe illness, and no physician could save her.	N,N
illness	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Just about this time, my dear sweet boy, who lies sleeping there, was born, and my husband was attacked with a severe lingering illness.	N,N
illness	[('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESENTMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She had heard of the emperor's illness, and was therefore come to sing to him of hope and trust.	N,N
hiding the face	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She folded her hands, and hid her face in the cotton curtains of the bed, and wept.	Sa,Sa
hiding the face	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, "Throw the rascal up here!"	F,F
hiding the face	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth.	N,Su+
arguing	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"You have slept soundly while I was arguing with the old man whether it was a story or a fairy tale!"	N,N
arguing	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Anna Maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw, and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!	Su-,Su-
arguing	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones.	A,A
arguing	[('DISBELIEF', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESENTMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But it is unwise to argue with the police; he gave his brother a peppermint, and watched him out of sight.	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then they tore of her dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it.	H,H
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The storm would not leave this little sentry-house alone, but must needs tear it from its fastenings, and roll it down the street; and, wonderfully enough, it stopped opposite to the door of the dirty journeyman plasterer, who had saved three lives at the last fire, but the sentry-house thought nothing of that.	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Oh, my poor mother!" he cried, while the tears rolled down his cheeks.	Sa,Sa
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Such tears as these cannot be washed out, even when the nightcap is forgotten.	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.	H,H
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It would be a sin to tear up a book like this.	N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the sister cried, "Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wild beast, and tear me to pieces."	F,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A record of this bright display will live in the memory of man, for through it the pupil in the military school was in tears and sorrow.	Sa,Sa

tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little people who now play on that spot know nothing of the old tale, else would they fancy they heard a child crying deep below the earth, and the dewdrops on each blade of grass would be to them tears of woe.

tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The faster he played, the more violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.	A,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They tore up trees in their sore need, and defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow."	N,N

N,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Hold fast! hold fast!" the spectre would cry; and as Anne Lisbeth murmured these words to herself, the whole of her dream was suddenly recalled to her memory, when the mother had clung to her, and uttered these words, when, amid the crashing of worlds, her sleeve had been torn, and she had slipped from the grasp of her child, who wanted to hold her up in that terrible hour.	N,F
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The tears of her husband fell on her forehead, but she took no notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered.	Sa,Sa
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he tried him, his strength had increased so much that he could tear an old tree out of the ground.	N,N

A,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And then they all hung on her, but there were too many; and as they clung the sleeve was torn, and Anne Lisbeth fell down in horror, and awoke.	F,F
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the clever servant had placed himself in the bed instead of his master, and when the maid came there, he tore off from her the mantle in which she had wrapped herself, and chased her out with rods.	A,N
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the huntsman arose and said: "Gracious lord father she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a chicken."	N,N

tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And then he told his wife about the old house and the old man, and of the tin soldier which he had sent across, because he thought the old man was lonely; and he related the story so clearly that tears came into the eyes of the young wife for the old house and the old man.	H,Sa
tears	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('HOPEFULNESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Not a tear came into his eye; he felt he was no longer Molly's friend.	Sa,N

trembling hands	[('RELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('ANTICIPATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king"s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her.

eyes that water	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When any one takes one of these and holds it to his eye, and looks at a drop of water from the pond yonder, he sees above a thousand wonderful creatures that are otherwise never discerned in the water.	N,N
eyes that water	[('HURT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"You had better not look at me in that way," said the soldier; "you will make your eyes water;" and then he seated him also upon the apron, and opened the chest.	N,N
clutching one’s hands	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But as soon as she stepped into the cold water, a sudden faintness seized her; she clutched at the air convulsively with her hand, took one step forward, and fell.	N,N
crossing the legs	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might.

crossing the legs	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival rod seemed to grow larger and taller, and it turned round and said to the paper flowers, "How can you put such things in a child's head? they are all foolish fancies;" and then the doll was exactly like the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat, and looked as yellow and as cross as he did; but the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs, and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll.

leaning against one another	[('LOVE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In olden times, Hauschen Street was not paved, and passengers would stumble out of one hole into another, as they generally do in unfrequented highways; and the street was so narrow, and the booths leaning against each other were so close together, that in the summer time a sail would be stretched across the street from one booth to another opposite.

laughing	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round.

laughing	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and jewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the people laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in snow.	N,Sa
laughing	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So she took him by the wrist, and he laughed till he nearly choked; and when she came to the fourth finger, there was a gold ring on it, as if it knew there was to be a betrothal.	H,H

scratching	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board.	N,N
scratching	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!	N,N
scratching	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The king's son also received several good scratches, but the sun was shining on his way, and it is he whom we will now follow, for he was a quick fellow.	N,N
scratching	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Oh that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard!	N,N
scratching	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The boar, however, had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, "Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame."	A,Su+
scratching	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Celebrity is always something!" said the drummer; and so he scratched his own name there, and his little son's name likewise.	H,N
scratching	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that the blood ran down.	F,N
scratching	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.	N,N

scratching	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Then we shall not meet," said the king's son, nodding to the poor boy, who went into the deepest part of the wood, where the thorns tore his shabby clothes and scratched his hands, face, and feet until they bled.	N,N
scratching	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts.	A,N
scratching	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out "isn't mouse" and changed it to "I hope it will be fine," and she gave her letter to the postman.	N,N
scratching	[('ANXIETY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell.	N,N

A,N
holding the head in the hands	[('ANNOYANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Will you be quiet? or I'll break your screaming head;" and she swung about the fire-pot which she held in her hand, while the boy crouched to the earth and screamed.	A,F
holding the head in the hands	[('ANNOYANCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside, and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child"s head off.

a gasp	[('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When his request was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water.	N,Sa
wanting to be alone	[('RESENTMENT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES'), ('DISAPPOINTMENT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"I would rather you let that alone," said the man, "for I do not willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to satisfy your hunger."	F,F
wanting to be alone	[('RESENTMENT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES'), ('DISAPPOINTMENT', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The King, however, went so frequently away to his dear children that the Queen observed his absence; she was curious and wanted to know what he did when he was quite alone in the forest.	N,N

wishing for comfort	[('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Sorry as he was to see his wish so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day more beautiful.	Sa,Sa
headache	[('ANGER', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('HATRED', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('NERVOUSNESS', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	But guessing was of very little use; it made his bark ache, and this pain is as bad for a slender fir-tree, as headache is for us.	N,N
hesitating	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	He hesitated, but driven by a mysterious force, he obeyed the voice and went through the iron-door into a large spacious hall, whose ceiling, walls and floor were made of shining polished square stones, on each of which were cut letters which were unknown to him.

hesitating	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	He had something else to say, which made him hesitate in a strange manner.	N,F
hesitating	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Still Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him--	N,N
hesitating	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Mr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with the hook--hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock.	N,N
hesitating	[('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	And yet, when the fire was extinguished, and the goblin again began to reflect, he hesitated, and said at last, "I must divide myself between the two; I cannot quite give up the huckster, because of the jam."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Sit fast, when you dance," said he, addressing the shoes, and slapping the soles with his hand.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"You are the right sort to dance with, certainly," said she, turning her back upon him.	D,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing still.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, "I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask."	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"But flowers cannot dance?" cried little Ida.	N,N

dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, "I have travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was dancing upon one leg, and singing:	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Where do the beautiful flowers dance?" asked little Ida.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When the dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	ANNE LISBETH was a beautiful young woman, with a red and white complexion, glittering white teeth, and clear soft eyes; and her footstep was light in the dance, but her mind was lighter still.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But the old goblin danced about the room with his young bride, and exchanged boots with her, which is more fashionable than exchanging rings.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"So," said the bear; "fiddling is a thing I should like to understand too, that I might dance whenever I had a fancy.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Will you dance with me?" said the rough doll.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"No," said he, "I won"t dance with a pussy cat.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the king"s son lost sight of her, and could not find out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said to him, "The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I think she must have sprung into the pear-tree."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And the little creature danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing in the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges, wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The faster he played, the more violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.	A,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They slept in twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody could find out how it happened, or where they had been.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and singing--	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	In the same courtyard two of the merry children were playing who had danced round the tree at Christmas, and had been so happy.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	He danced about and pinched his brother, singing--	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	We should suit so well; you spring, and I dance.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the door of the room opened, and a number of beautiful flowers danced in.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	There was a golden treasure in his bosom, the power of sound; it burst forth on his violin as if the instrument had been a complete organ, and as if all the elves of a midsummer night were dancing across the strings.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	After work, came the recreations, dancing and playing in the greenwood, and the "harvest homes."	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance; and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door of his chamber was left open.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed mightily delighted.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"We'll dance the bung out of the cask at carnival time," said he; "I'll prepare a merry tune for you and for myself too.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then their anxieties are dispelled; and at even they join in the dance at the feast given in the great hall at Borglum.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Ashputtel"s two sisters were asked to come; so they called her up, and said, "Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king"s feast."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The carnival rod hopped about among the flowers on its three red stilted feet, and stamped quite loud when it danced the Mazurka; the flowers could not perform this dance, they were too light to stamp in that manner.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"'Now, let us have a dance,' said the fire-tongs; and then how they danced and stuck up one leg in the air.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She gathered herself up, and hastened to the churchyard; but black crosses and black ravens danced before her eyes, and she could not distinguish one from the other.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Where do my twelve daughters dance at night?" he answered, "With twelve princes in a castle under ground."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"You, Ashputtel!" said she; "you who have nothing to wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to the ball?	D,D
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king"s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her.	F,F
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Now all the flowers are certainly dancing in there," she thought, "oh how much I should like to see them," but she did not dare move for fear of disturbing her father and mother.	H,F
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, "I never saw any one half so beautiful."	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They were even lighter and more delicate than the flowers from which they were born; and as the flames were extinguished, and nothing remained of the paper but black ashes, these little beings danced upon it; and whenever they touched it, bright red sparks appeared.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	It was not very large, and the floor was of lime; but when he danced with his bride on the lime-covered floor, it was to him white and shining, and from every stone in the wall flowers seemed to spring forth and decorate the room as with the richest tapestry.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	After the dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the soup.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The wolf is dead!" and danced for joy round about the well with their mother.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"Do you remember," said the canary, "the pretty maidens who used to dance in the tents that were spread out beneath the sweet blossoms?	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But when she wanted to go to the right, the shoes danced to the left, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danced down the room, down the stairs through the street, and out through the gates of the town.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	He has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on top of the cupboard!	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the pennies hopped and danced about in the most amusing manner.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She dropped Pigling's hand and commenced to dance, singing-- presently.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The shoes bore her away over thorns and stumps till she was all torn and bleeding; she danced away over the heath to a lonely little house.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	I cannot come in, for I must dance."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She danced and was obliged to go on dancing over field and meadow, in rain and sunshine, by night and by day- but by night it was most horrible.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	It was no use, he might make himself great and tall, or remain a little wax doll with a large black hat; still he must dance.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The people came from the town, and walked upon it, and they say there were dancing and skating upon it, I believe, and a great feasting.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air.	A,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then they rose up and opened their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager to begin dancing.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	So whilst he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And so, on every summer day the dance was repeated, the same questions asked, and the same answers given.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	He lifted her into the carriage, but her feet continued to dance, so that she kicked the good old lady violently.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	"There is something going on within there," said the other lizard; "they propped up the top of the hill with four red posts, till cock-crow this morning, so that it is thoroughly aired, and the elfin girls have learnt new dances; there is something."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The feast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you and I had been of the party.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And as she danced past the open church door she saw an angel there in long white robes, with wings reaching from his shoulders down to the earth; his face was stern and grave, and in his hand he held a broad shining sword.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	She lay awake a long time after she was in bed, thinking how pretty it must be to see all the beautiful flowers dancing in the king's garden.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Dance you shall, from door to door, and where proud and wicked children live you shall knock, so that they may hear you and fear you!	D,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But her mother said, "It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame": and off she went with her two daughters to the ball.	D,D
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the elfin girls had to dance, first in the usual way, and then with stamping feet, which they performed very well; then followed the artistic and solo dance.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And she went quickly up to the church-door; but when she came there, the red shoes were dancing before her, and she was frightened, and turned back.	F,F
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And they were standing before the magnificently illuminated gate; the broad steps were adorned with carpets and flowers, and dance music was sounding through the festive halls.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	All the will-o'-the-wisps are ordered to be there to hold a torch dance, as it is called.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then she seated herself on the edge of the drawer, and thought that perhaps one of the flowers would ask her to dance; but none of them came.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Within there were songs and dancing; King Waldemar and the young gayly-dressed ladies of the court were dancing together.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	At the second note the hangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and all the people who had followed to look on.	A,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other!	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	His mighty summits was crowned with spreading fresh green foliage; the sunbeams played among the leaves and branches, and the air was full of fragrance from herb and blossom; painted butterflies chased each other; the summer flies danced around him, as if the world had been created merely for them to dance and be merry in.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The children then danced about with their pretty toys, and no one noticed the tree, except the children's maid who came and peeped among the branches to see if an apple or a fig had been forgotten.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	No one could tell where the dance begun, or where it ended, nor indeed which were legs and which were arms, for they were all flying about together, like the shavings in a saw-pit!	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But the mother said, "No, no! you slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go."	A,A
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The ladies danced and clapped their hands for joy.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf met him, and asked him what made him so merry.	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They danced on till three o"clock in the morning, and then all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	But just as Karen was lifting up her foot to get in too, the old soldier said: "Dear me, what pretty dancing shoes!" and Karen could not help it, she was obliged to dance a few steps; and when she had once begun, her legs continued to dance.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Not a singing bird was ever heard there, neither did men dance to the sound of the pipe.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And so she went boldly on; but she had not got farther than the churchyard gate when she saw the red shoes dancing along before her.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced to dance, for it was a magical dance.	A,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	There they all landed, and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The flowers were dancing gracefully on the floor, making turns and holding each other by their long green leaves as they swung round.	H,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They led her into the middle of the room, where the moon shone, and danced with her, while all the other flowers formed a circle round them.	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	When the bear heard the music, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a while, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little tailor, "Hark you, is the fiddle heavy?"	H,H
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	They dance on the green rampart, just on the place where, according to the old story, the ground always sank in, and where a sportive, frolicsome child had been lured by means of flowers, toys and sweetmeats into an open grave ready dug for it, and which was afterwards closed over the child; and from that moment, the old story says, the ground gave way no longer, the mound remained firm and fast, and was quickly covered with the green turf.	F,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the former one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the king"s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to dance, he said, "This lady is /my/ partner, sir."	N,N
dancing	[('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	And when she came in it to the ball, everyone wondered at her beauty: but the king"s son, who was waiting for her, took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to dance, he said as before, "This lady is dancing with me."	N,N

flight	[('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	And during their whole flight the elder-tree smelt so sweetly; he noticed the roses and the fresh beeches, but the elder-tree smelt much stronger, for the flowers were fixed on the little girl's bosom, against which the boy often rested his head during the flight.

flight	[('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	I myself helped to rescue cattle and things, nothing alive burnt, except a flight of pigeons, which flew into the fire, and the yard dog, of which I had not thought; one could hear him howl out of the fire, and this howling I still hear when I wish to sleep; and when I have fallen asleep, the great rough dog comes and places himself upon me, and howls, presses, and tortures me.	Sa,N
flight	[('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	In its topmost branches the wood-pigeon built her nest, and the cuckoo carried out his usual vocal performances, and his well-known notes echoed amid the boughs; and in autumn, when the leaves looked like beaten copper plates, the birds of passage would come and rest upon the branches before taking their flight across the sea.

flight	[('OVERWHELMED', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	And when he came before the enemy, there was a battle, and great danger, and it rained shot until his comrades fell on all sides, and when the leader also was killed, those left were about to take flight, but the youth stepped forth, spoke boldly to them, and cried, "We will not let our fatherland be ruined!"

trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They saw him anxiously feeling over an old ragged coat in which pieces of gold were sewn, and his clammy fingers trembled.	N,N
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He remembered a story told of her, that on one occasion, when she was carrying a basket full of wine and provisions, her husband, who had watched her footsteps, stepped forward and asked her angrily what she carried in her basket, whereupon, with fear and trembling, she answered, "Roses, which I have plucked from the garden."	N,F
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The poor little thing trembled so with cold, that the boy ran homeward as fast as he could.	N,Sa
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Lean as a skeleton, trembling with cold, and hunger, the old man was clinging with all his thoughts to his money.	N,N
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After this, the tree tried not to tremble at all, though the fire frightened him; he was so anxious not to hurt any of the beautiful ornaments, even while their brilliancy dazzled him.	F,F
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The pastor's hand trembled; he dared not stretch it out, he did not venture to pull a hair out of the sinner's head.	F,F
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then his hand trembled in mine, and he became pale as a corpse.	Sa,F
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The flame trembled on his breast and in his heart, and it was in the peasant's room that his heart became one for the Danish arms.	N,N
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go.	F,F
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	For a time he had trembled on the high pedestal on which he had placed himself, till at last he toppled over, and ruin came.	N,N
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The paper boat rocked up and down, and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not change; he looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket.	F,N
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But she, trembling in every limb, did not think of the adornment.	F,F
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I saw it, I understood the cause, and I believe my hand trembled too.	N,F
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Tiny trembled very much; she was quite frightened, for the bird was large, a great deal larger than herself,- she was only an inch high.	F,F
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It trembled so with joy in all its branches, that one of the candles fell among the green leaves and burnt some of them.	H,H
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"To-morrow I will not tremble," thought he; "I will enjoy all my splendor, and I shall hear the story of Humpty Dumpty again, and perhaps Ivede-Avede."	N,N
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"And so he spoke to you in that way, did he, my child?" said the washer-woman, and her lips trembled as she spoke.	Su-,N
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it fell to the ground and broke.	Sa,N
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run out of his mouth.	Sa,N
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Anastasia trembled, and burst into tears.	Su+,H
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.	F,F
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king"s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her.	F,F
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and said:	F,F
trembling	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EXCITEMENT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And this feeling of yearning trembled through every branch, through every leaf, as warmly and fervently as if they had been the fibres of a human heart.	Sa,N
eye rolling	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They rolled their eyes, and mother owl, beating her wings, said: "Don't listen to her!	D,N
eye rolling	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.	H,H
eye rolling	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he was standing down below at the bottom, they rolled down the largest mill-stone and thought they had broken his skull, but he cried, "Chase away those hens from the well, they are scratching in the sand up there, and throwing the grains into my eyes, so that I can"t see."	A,N
eye rolling	[('DEFENSIVENESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.	Sa,Sa
sticking a tongue out	[('CONTEMPT', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Yes," answered the cat, "you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window."	A,D
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Shake me, shake me, I pray; my apples, one and all, are ripe," it cried.	F,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now I shake the pen!	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She only shook her head at him.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All-gone; what can that mean?" and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep.	N,Su-
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She got out of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he still continued sleeping.	A,Sa
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She took care to do everything according to the old woman"s bidding and every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the feathers flew about like so many snowflakes.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Shake, shake, hazel-tree, Gold and silver over me!"	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little tree is shaking itself."	Su-,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said, "No, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, I might very soon go begging myself.	D,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"That is too bad!" cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook.	A,A
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	We will sing you to sleep, and shake you to sleep, and it will do your old twigs good; they will even crackle with pleasure.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Gladly would she have taken the body home with her; but that was impossible; so she took up the poor head with the closed eyes, kissed the cold lips, and shook the mould out of the beautiful hair.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored so loud that the branches shook.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The little tree said, "Then I will shake myself," and began to shake herself so that all her leaves fell off; a girl who came up with her water-pitcher saw that, and said, "Little tree, why art thou shaking thyself?"	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She only shook her head.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Have I not reason to shake myself?"	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she went upstairs in the form of the Queen, nursed the baby, shook up its little bed, covered it over, and then swam away again down the gutter in the shape of a duck.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit, with the goose for the king"s dinner upon it; the butler finished his draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave the boy the box on his ear.	N,Su+
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: "Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat.	D,D
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And the old man who had spoken of all this shook his head mournfully, and said, "Forgotten!	N,Sa
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Shake me, shake me, I pray," cried the tree; "my apples, one and all, are ripe."	F,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The poet shook his head, so also did the clerk; each retained his own opinion, and so they parted.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Benjamin Bunny came out of the dark tunnel shaking the sand from his ears; he cleaned his face with his paws.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single apple left upon it.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Already a new emperor had been chosen and the people who stood in the street asked the lord-in-waiting how the old emperor was; but he only said, "Pooh!" and shook his head.	D,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of them; but shake hands with the princess last.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he shook his head and said, "It cannot possibly be the bishop himself."	Su-,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The boar, however, had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, "Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame."	A,Su+
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In her joy she hastily gathered her basket full, thanked the little men, shook hands with each of them, and ran home to take her step-mother what she had longed for so much.	H,H
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Meantime the countryman began to look grave, and shook his head.	Sa,A
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The poor man"s wife shook hands with him, and welcomed him, and said he was to make himself at home and put up with what they had got; they had not much to offer him, but what they had they would give him with all their hearts.	H,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Shake, shake, hazel-tree, Gold and silver over me!"	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that whenever they shook the window the little door opposite shook in answer.	Su+,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she shook up its pillow, laid the child down again, and covered it with the little quilt.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Let me see him," said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, "It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy."	H,H
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He went to sleep again and snored until the windows shook.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last she came to the cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from shaking.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All the children liked her very much, but when they spoke about dress and grandeur and beauty she would shake her head.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Worse still, she neglected to make the old woman"s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the feathers might fly about.	D,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Tweet, tweet!" said the little bird, for one of his wings being broken, he found it difficult to shake himself; but he quite understood that the bath was meant kindly, and he said, "You are very kind-hearted, madam;" but he did not wish for a second bath.	H,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on the head with them: but they only said, "It must be near morning, for the wind shakes the fir-apples down."	N,Su-
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The children were playing with an apple; they shook the apple, and heard the pips rattling in it.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The Danish and the Swedish flags wave, and Danes and Swedes say, "Good-day," and "Thank you" to each other, not with cannons, but with a friendly shake of the hand; and they exchange white bread and biscuits with each other, because foreign articles taste the best.	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Shake, shake, hazel-tree, Gold and silver over me!"	N,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The woman stared at him and shook her head.	D,N
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At first Ib said not a word, but he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then he spoke,- "Christina must not refuse this good fortune."	Sa,Sa
shaking	[('REMORSE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	You must be very careful, however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle."	F,N
biting the lip	[('SADNESS', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED'), ('DISGUST', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Ida and Anna Dorothea wept bitterly, Joanna stood, pale and proud, biting her lips till the blood came; but what could that avail?	Sa,Sa
fatigue	[('DEPRESSION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('RAGE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('PARANOIA', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('LONELINESS', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	The wind roared around it, and could have readily related the story of its origin and of its sweet chimes, and the wind could also tell of him to whom he had brought fresh air when, in the woods of a neighboring country, he had sunk down exhausted with fatigue, with no other worldly possessions than hope for the future, and a written leaf from "Fiesco."	N,N
fatigue	[('DEPRESSION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('RAGE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('PARANOIA', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('LONELINESS', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	The journey had also tired Kaela; but she was always fatigued, that was the worst of it.	N,N
fatigue	[('DEPRESSION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('RAGE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('PARANOIA', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('LONELINESS', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	Suddenly a feeling of fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep, that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him.	Su-,N
fatigue	[('DEPRESSION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('RAGE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('PARANOIA', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('LONELINESS', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	May we ask you to step down into this rich mud, you must be fatigued after your journey."	N,N
fatigue	[('DEPRESSION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('RAGE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('PARANOIA', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('LONELINESS', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble, he felt no fatigue.	H,N
fatigue	[('DEPRESSION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('RAGE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('PARANOIA', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('LONELINESS', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	It was a glorious spectacle; but the stomachs of the travellers were empty, their bodies exhausted with fatigue, and all the longings of their heart turned towards a resting-place for the night; but where to find one they knew not.	Sa,N
fatigue	[('DEPRESSION', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('RAGE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM'), ('PARANOIA', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS'), ('LONELINESS', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.	N,N
chills	[('DREAD', 'INTERNAL SENSATIONS')]	"Stern death, thy chilling silence waketh dread; Yet in thy darkest hour there may be light.	N,N
dancing in place	[('ELATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They dance on the green rampart, just on the place where, according to the old story, the ground always sank in, and where a sportive, frolicsome child had been lured by means of flowers, toys and sweetmeats into an open grave ready dug for it, and which was afterwards closed over the child; and from that moment, the old story says, the ground gave way no longer, the mound remained firm and fast, and was quickly covered with the green turf.	F,N
holding in a breath	[('DESIRE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I heard him sighing like a soul in despair; I heard him praying, and I noticed how he held his breath.	Sa,Sa
wet eyes	[('SHAME', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before.	H,H
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	The following day the king"s daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it, she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it fast with both hands.	Su-,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	"Hold fast! hold fast!" the spectre would cry; and as Anne Lisbeth murmured these words to herself, the whole of her dream was suddenly recalled to her memory, when the mother had clung to her, and uttered these words, when, amid the crashing of worlds, her sleeve had been torn, and she had slipped from the grasp of her child, who wanted to hold her up in that terrible hour.	N,F
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	First they peeped into the basket containing the eels and the sucking-pig; then they must needs pull out the pig and take it in their hands, and feel it, and touch it; and as they both wanted to hold it at the same time, the consequence was that they let it fall into the water, and the pig sailed away with the stream.	Su-,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	Then he wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him, and said, "Listen, my friend, to what I am going to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak.	H,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: "I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening.	H,Sa
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	She sprang up and wanted to run away, but whithersoever she turned herself, she was continually held back by thick hedges of thorns through which she could not break.	N,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	When she knew the answer to the riddle she wanted to steal away, but he held her mantle so fast that she was forced to leave it behind her.	Su-,N
wanting to be held	[('RELIEF', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')]	When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.	N,Su+
making demands	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	My mother could make fishermen's nets, for which there was a great demand here in the bay; and we lived a long time by the side of the sea, the beautiful sea, that had a taste like tears, and in its colors reminded me of the stag that wept red tears; for sometimes its waters were red, and sometimes green or blue.	N,N
making demands	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third demand.	N,N
making demands	[('IMPATIENCE', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')]	So he took a great stone which was lying there, and placed it in the basket, and when it was about half way up, his false brothers above cut the rope, so that the basket with the stone fell to the ground, and they thought that he was dead, and ran away with the three princesses, making them promise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them, and then they went to the King, and each demanded a princess in marriage.	N,N
holding one’s breath	[('HOPEFULNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The children held them to their mouths, and tried to blow away the whole coronal with one puff of the breath.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The bottle had no time to think, when raised so suddenly; and before it was aware, it reached the highest point it had ever attained in its life.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Now something rustled among the bushes, and a little boy stood before the king's son, in wooden shoes and such a short jacket that the sleeves did not reach to his wrists.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to kill his brother.	A,A
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When Little Claus reached home again, he immediately sent a boy to Great Claus, requesting him to lend him a bushel measure.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When she reached the dwarfs" cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, "Fine wares to sell!"	A,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The man journeyed on day and night till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the leaf floated down the stream, carrying Tiny far away out of reach of land.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was late in the evening when we reached my mother's door.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As he reached the half-open door, he saw a light and went in.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I shall be obliged to go back to the king's new market," said he, "where there are plenty of carriages standing, or I shall never reach Christian's Haven."	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The door was locked, and he could not reach the knocker.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was dangerously ill, and near his death.	F,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	On reaching the entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every step she took.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached her the golden slipper.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The Florentine, Angiolo Bronzino, painted this picture; most beautiful is the expression on the face of the two children, who appear to have full confidence that they shall reach heaven at last.	H,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The volunteer had, however, presence of mind enough to whisper, "It is for a wager;" but the first thing he did, when he reached his own room, was to put a large blister on his neck, and another on his back, that his crazy fit might be cured.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.	F,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The laundress slipped and tottered through the lane, and round the corner, into the street where the mayor lived; and just as she reached the front of his house, she sank down upon the pavement.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The written leaf, the last farewell of the bridegroom to his bride, would only bring sorrow when once it reached her hands; but where were those hands, so soft and delicate, which had once spread the table-cloth on the fresh grass in the green wood, on the day of her betrothal?	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was carried away farther and farther from the shore, till it reached the open sea.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he reached home, the two other apprentices were there again as well, and each of them certainly had brought a horse with him, but one of them was a blind one, and the other lame.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As he grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth, so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, bright sun itself.	H,H
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All night long they walked, and it was morning before they reached the mill.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon you for ever."	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And then, taking hold of the creepers and roots, he climbed up on the wet stones, where water-snakes were wriggling and the toads, as it were, barked at him: he reached the top before the sun, seen from such a height, had quite set.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the king"s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Get money," she replied; "for you must know that when you reach the ground under the tree, you will find yourself in a large hall, lighted up by three hundred lamps; you will then see three doors, which can be easily opened, for the keys are in all the locks.

reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then reached the ship and got home safe.	H,H
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I have been well paid for my horse," said he to himself when he reached home, entered his own room, and emptied all his money into a heap on the floor.	H,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	After he had taken the maiden up on his horse, the old woman showed him the way, and the King reached his royal palace again, where the wedding was celebrated.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"This tree I shall guard and cherish," she said, "that it may grow large by Christmas Eve, and reach from the ground to the ceiling, to be covered and adorned with flaming candles, golden apples, and little figures.	H,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The King took her in his arms, carried her to his horse, and rode home with her, and when he reached the royal castle he caused her to be dressed in beautiful garments, and gave her all things in abundance.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Under the shield of the Pope, the law cannot reach thee; but Jens Glob shall reach thee!"	A,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The tiny little creature woke very early in the morning, and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was, for she could see nothing but water on every side of the large green leaf, and no way of reaching the land.	Sa,Sa
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	As soon as the stone was laden, it began to rise up on high with the maiden and the young man, and mounted through the opening of the ceiling into the upper hall, from whence they then could easily reach the open air.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the procession went onwards, and they reached the stream.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	However, the duck, who slept in the open air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	You will reach a village in the evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you to be very poor and mean."	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And as she danced past the open church door she saw an angel there in long white robes, with wings reaching from his shoulders down to the earth; his face was stern and grave, and in his hand he held a broad shining sword.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He went to the tower in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he would rise from his bed, creep down the ladder- for it could scarcely be called a flight of stairs- and when he reached the fire-pan not a spark could be seen; so he had just to go back again to bed.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So Gambling Hansel went, but when he reached the house where the other gambling vagabonds were gathered together, they, although they had won all that he had, greeted him clamorously, and said, "Hansel, do come in."	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He tried it; but before he reached the entry, the rest discovered what he was about, and seized him by the feet, when, luckily for him, off came the goloshes, and with them vanished the whole enchantment.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he ordered his servants to bring costly coverings and wrap him in them, that the gnats might no longer be able to reach him.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the wild wood-path they met a forester who knew Ib, and, by his help, Ib and Christina reached home, where they found every one had been very anxious about them.	H,F
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	We reached our old home; but the cottage was in ruins, and we had to build a new one.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	To Egypt, where we shall see three-cornered houses built of stone, with pointed tops that reach nearly to the clouds.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Tiny pleased him, and she was glad of it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her, and the country through which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone upon the water, till it glittered like liquid gold.	H,H
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So Little Claus climbed to the roof of the shed, and while he turned himself to get comfortable, he discovered that the wooden shutters, which were closed, did not reach to the tops of the windows of the farmhouse, so that he could see into a room, in which a large table was laid out with wine, roast meat, and a splendid fish.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Borglum's bishop reaches the church; but Olaf Hase will scarce do so, however hard he may ride.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The girl reached the plate to him, but the king"s son threw off the quilt, and said: "You old sinner, why did you want to kill me?	A,Su-

reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the people had reached the sea-wall, where the sparks were flying round.	H,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At length they reached the warm countries, where the sun shines brightly, and the sky seems so much higher above the earth.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had dared to attempt to reach foreign territories unnoticed, and must therefore give up fatherland, mother, his dearest friends, all, or sink down into the stream of common life.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to himself, "I will remain here and wait for her," so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king"s daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.	Sa,Sa
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther.	F,F
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the woodman laughed, and said, "How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse"s bridle."	H,Su-
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar.	Su+,Su+
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when night came on, they went into a wood to sleep.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ten of them are carried away; but Olaf Hase and two of the youngest men reach the farther side.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Though the water was clear, the sun never looked down far enough into the well to mirror itself in the waters; but as far as its beams could reach, green things grew forth between the stones in the sides of the well.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It was the dawn of morning before the wicked man reached home; he took off his hat, and went into his sister's room.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she took off the hinges, and said, "Frederick told me to lock the door, but surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me."	Su-,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The road led him up a mountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him.	H,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the darkness he saw a small light; he went towards it and reached a cottage.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then up he got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till he reached his mother"s house, and told her how very easy the road to good luck was.	H,H
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I got out of bed, and reached the window; I could not crawl any farther from weakness and exhaustion; but I managed to open the window.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They are addressed in the language of their country, and the piano sounds for them with melodies of their native land; and before these have died away, the chord has been struck, the wire of thought that reaches to the land of the sufferers announces that they are rescued.	N,N

reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At two o"clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses; but even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, "I know he has fallen asleep."	Sa,A
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She drove across the country in a grazier's cart, and then got out, and continued her journey on foot, and thus reached the count's castle.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had a long way to go before he reached the river, and Little Claus was not a very light weight to carry.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When they reached the farmyard, there was a great disturbance, two families were fighting for an eel's head, which, after all, was carried off by the cat.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He was as well formed and as beautiful as a little child could be, and had wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The window stood open the whole day, and the little elf could easily have reached the roses, or any of the flowers; but he could not find it in his heart to leave one so afflicted.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It has struck, and is fast embedded in the sand; but the rocket apparatus has thrown a rope on board, and formed a bridge from the wreck to the mainland; and all on board are saved, and reach the land, and are wrapped in warm blankets; and to-day they are invited to the farm at the convent of Borglum.

reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They reached home safely, and burst into the rabbit hole.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So as soon as he reached home he took the largest sack he could find and went over to Little Claus.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In olden times, when the Lord himself still used to walk about on this earth amongst men, it once happened that he was tired and overtaken by the darkness before he could reach an inn.	N,Sa
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He could scarcely reach the water jug that he had placed by his bed, and the last drop was gone.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"I am willing," said the fox, and showed him the by-paths and ways by which at length they reached the cellar.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They walked on till they reached the picture gallery, and mounted the same staircase up which he had ridden that night on the Metal Pig.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She remembered that the route by the sea-shore was two miles shorter than by the high road; and as the weather was clear, and there would be moonlight, she determined to make her way on foot, and to start at once, that she might reach home the next day.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His wings were dry now, so they carried him to a great distance, till at last he reached a hothouse, where a sash of the glass roof was partly open, so he quietly slipped in and buried himself in the warm earth.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The porter's bell he was unable to reach, and however was he to get loose!	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the cock drew the carriage himself, but when he got it over and reached the other shore with the dead hen, and was about to draw over the others who were sitting behind as well, there were too many of them, the carriage ran back, and they all fell into the water together, and were drowned.	Su-,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	By sunrise they reached a large inn, where Little Claus stopped and went to get something to eat.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When he reached the gate of the castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick, and it flew wide open at once and he passed through.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He rose up without delay, eager to start on his way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which direction he ought to go.	Su+,H
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Alas! dear sir," said she, "yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only the birds and the flies--man cannot."	Sa,Sa
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ferry me across first," said the luck-child, "and then I will tell you how you can be set free," and when he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil"s advice: "Next time any one comes, who wants to be ferried over, just put the oar in his hand."	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The tailor felt in his pockets, and reached him a handful; they were, however, not nuts, but pebbles.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince"s kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great many years.	H,H
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But it had to travel, till at length it reached land- a foreign country.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But when she began her song, and it reached Roland"s ears, he sprang up and cried: "I know the voice, that is the true bride, I will have no other!"	Su+,Su+
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They both rowed with all their strength day and night, and their little boat flew so swiftly that they reached the old King before the others did.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There not even the light of a torch or lantern could reach it, much less the brightness of the sun or moon.	N,N
reaching	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him: "You will never see your father and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free, and I have compassion on you.	Sa,N
gasping	[('RELIEF', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When his request was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water.	N,Sa
muttering	[('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along, "This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done."	F,F
muttering	[('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Molly, however, did, though she only said the words, "Lady Halle, Lady Halle," loudly and distinctly; the rest she muttered so much under her breath that Anthony felt certain she had really said nothing; and yet she looked quite bold and saucy, just as she did sometimes when she was in the garden with a number of other little girls; they would all stand round him together, and want to kiss him, because he did not like to be kissed, and pushed them away.	N,N
muttering	[('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I fell to the ground, and the stranger muttered some words which deprived me of consciousness.	N,N
muttering	[('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"What is it that you are always muttering between your teeth?"	A,N
muttering	[('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: "That will be a dainty mouthful!"	H,H
muttering	[('ANGUISH', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to himself: "Ah, if I could but shudder!	Sa,N
licking the lips	[('UNEASE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.	N,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He looked down, and there was Bellissima, little smooth-shaven Bellissima, barking as if she would have said, "Here I am too; why are you sitting there?"	Su-,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They flew into the tower and out again, they looked down upon the throng below, and they also looked into the windows of the church, and screamed out aloud what they saw there.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	At last came the little dwarf"s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat down upon a stone and cried.	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	You all stood looking very grave, although it was very difficult to do so, but I laughed so to myself that I fell down from the table, and got a bruise, which is there still; I know it was not right to laugh.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I remember one day distinctly: the rain was pouring down in torrents; the dust-man had come to the house where I was in service; I went down with the dust-bin and stood for a moment in the doorway, and looked at the dreadful weather.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head, the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless.	Su-,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When one of the chickens was swallowed down, and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said: "What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what"s right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take another draught it would do me no harm."	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him.	Su-,Su-
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	These loose, airy wool-flowers are very beautiful, and look like fine snowy feathers or down.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And when he had said that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery eyes.	A,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"The old woman is right," said the robbers, and they ceased looking for the finger and sat down.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser, and looked suspiciously at the tea-cups.	Su-,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	From the street could be seen the room in which the walls were covered with leather, ragged and torn, and the green in the balcony hung straggling over the beams; they pulled it down quickly, for it looked ready to fall, and at last it was cleared away altogether.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Presently a fox met him: "What"s the matter, my friend?" said he, "why do you hang down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?"	F,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The rich drove, the poor walked, but the way seemed to them extraordinarily long, and when they arrived at a number of willow trees on the border of the wood they sat down, looked up into the great branches and thought they were now really in the wood.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The grocer ran his finger down the advertisement column of his newspaper--"Lost, stolen or strayed, 10S. reward;" he looked suspiciously at Pig-wig.	N,A
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Though the water was clear, the sun never looked down far enough into the well to mirror itself in the waters; but as far as its beams could reach, green things grew forth between the stones in the sides of the well.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the shoe, that her white stockings were quite red.	N,Su-
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"O Frederick!" answered she, "I was cooking you a steak; but while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!"	D,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his white beard hung down.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So they looked up, and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal, and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.	A,A
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ida looked that way, and saw a slight carnival rod jumping down among the flowers as if it belonged to them; it was, however, very smooth and neat, and a little wax doll with a broad brimmed hat on her head, like the one worn by the lawyer, sat upon it.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came in and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her, "Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but every now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you the way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me free."	N,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with the hook--hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Their lives and their deeds, looked at after my own fashion, I write down in my diary, as every one ought to do.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon him attentively; he really was a first prize sound sleeper!	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The poor horses looked wretched; the flies settled on their backs in swarms, and they were only relieved when the coachmen got down and drove the creatures off.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water.	Su-,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	With pious gratitude the girl looked upon this glorious work of God, and bent down over one of the branches, that she might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"'Yes, to-day is your golden wedding-day,' said the little elder-tree mother, stretching her head down between the two old people, who thought that she was their neighbour who was nodding to them; they looked at each other and clasped hands.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The three daughters went every day beneath the tree, and looked to see if the wind had not blown down an apple, but they never by any chance found one, and the tree was so loaded with them that it was almost breaking, and the branches hung down to the ground.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There he stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking down upon everything else in the room.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The elder children broke off the flowers with long stems, bent the stalks one round the other, to form links, and made first a chain for the neck, then one to go across the shoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a wreath to wear round the head, so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands of green stems and golden flowers.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then it was carried down stairs and taken into the courtyard so quickly, that it forgot to think of itself, and could only look about, there was so much to be seen.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old walls of the castle.	Su-,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The paper boat rocked up and down, and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not change; he looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket.	F,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She said neither "thanks" nor "creak," but she looked down upon the little boy with her mild eyes; and then he said to the old man, "Where did you get that picture?"	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The servant maid and the little boy went down stairs directly to look for him; but he was nowhere to be seen, although once they nearly trod upon him.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, "Always be a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you."	N,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A person could walk up and down for a whole day through the streets, and tire himself out with looking at the pictures; and then he would know all about what people lived in the houses, for they had hung out their shields or signs; and, as grandfather said, it was a very instructive thing, in a great town, to know at once who the inhabitants were.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, "We will never bury her in the cold ground."	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah! well," he thought, "who knows? perhaps I may fall down too, and marry a princess;" and he looked forward joyfully to the next evening, expecting to be again decked out with lights and playthings, gold and fruit.	H,H
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The ass and the dog laid themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to see that everything was well.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Yes, she is smiling at the memory of that day, and many thoughts and recollections of the past; but the handsome young man is gone, and the rose has withered in the old book, and grandmother is sitting there, again an old woman, looking down upon the withered rose in the book.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pigling Bland who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a tear trickled down his cheek.	Sa,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The mayor pressed forward and said: "I will go down first, and look about me, and if things promise well I"ll call you."	Su+,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: "That is what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below there," and they rolled the barrel down into the water.	H,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Thousands of tapers were burning upon the green branches, and colored pictures, like those she had seen in the show-windows, looked down upon it all.	N,N
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the sun set, the clouds were as red as fire; it became quiet in the wood; he sank down on his knees, sang an evening hymn and said: "I shall never find what I am looking for!	D,Sa
looking down	[('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One day he said to her: "Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow." the woman also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating.	N,N
placing hands in one’s pockets	[('INDIFFERENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The son said: "Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower," and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.

wide eyes	[('PARANOIA', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('UNEASE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Ib and Christina looked at the wishing nuts with wide open eyes.	H,Su+
wide eyes	[('PARANOIA', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('UNEASE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	Then he went to the innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: "I never expected to see you alive again!	Su+,N
wide eyes	[('PARANOIA', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('UNEASE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"Heaven preserve us!" he thought, and opened his eyes wide, "I cannot see anything at all," but he did not say so.	Su-,Su-
wide eyes	[('PARANOIA', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('UNEASE', 'CUES OF SUPPRESSED')]	"How did you get all this money?" asked Great Claus, staring with wide open eyes at his neighbor's treasures.	N,Su-
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Oh, how they rushed upon it, till the branches cracked, and had it not been fastened with the glistening star to the ceiling, it must have been thrown down.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The dame was very old, but her eyes glistened like two stars.	H,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"How did you get all this money?" asked Great Claus, staring with wide open eyes at his neighbor's treasures.	N,Su-
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Dolls, exactly like real babies, were placed under the green leaves,- the tree had never seen such things before,- and at the very top was fastened a glittering star, made of tinsel.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One shooting star after another traversed the sky.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah!" there sat the dog, with the eyes as large as teacups, staring at him.	Su+,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The boys still played in the garden, and the youngest wore the golden star on his breast, with which the tree had been adorned during the happiest evening of its existence.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The angel seized it: the, pearl glittered like a star with seven-fold radiance.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All the people, amongst them Karen too, streamed towards the castle, where the little princess, in fine white clothes, stood before the window and allowed herself to be stared at.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He stared at them for some time.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"'I saw the Turkish angel myself," said one; "he had eyes like glittering stars, and a head like foaming water."	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I lay on my back in the boat, Anastasia leaned against me, while the stars above us glittered more brightly than the lamps in our church.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She saw the stars shining, so large and so bright, and she saw the moon gleaming; and then she saw the sun rise, and mount higher and higher.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The fruit gleamed like stars, and the room was filled with sounds of beautiful music.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	His staff had fallen out of his hand, and his eyes stared at the moon, about which his honest soul was wandering.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	It is a noble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand the stars."	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The stars became visible in broad daylight, large and sparkling, like clear and gentle eyes.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Her countenance glowed, and her eyes were like two stars.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The flame was as a star on his breast, and added another heart to the Danish arms.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she saw a star fall, leaving behind it a bright streak of fire.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He had never wanted to go; and the idea of standing all by himself in a crowded market, to be stared at, pushed, and hired by some big strange farmer was very disagreeable--	D,Sa
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Through the night of the grave we gaze upwards beyond the stars to the end of all things.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They were the same stars, and in the same position over me as when I used to sit in front of our hut at Delphi, and I had almost begun to fancy I was still there, when suddenly there was a splash in the water- Anastasia had fallen in; but in a moment Aphtanides has sprung in after her, and was now holding her up to me.	Su-,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Benjamin Bunny sat up, staring, his whiskers twitched.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	IT was bitterly cold, the sky glittered with stars, and not a breeze stirred.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The Christmas lights rose higher and higher, till they looked to her like the stars in the sky.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He will kiss every one in the room, great and small; yes, even the poor children who stand in the passage, or out in the street singing a carol about the 'Star of Bethlehem.'"	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared; and Jane leant against the kitchen dresser and smiled--but neither of them made any remark.	N,Sa
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A falling star gleamed across the sky.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then suddenly it appeared as if all the stars were shining with the radiance of the full moon on the many-colored flowers that decked the grave.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate.	Sa,Sa
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Peter and Benjamin flattened their noses against the window, and stared into the dusk.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	All the good stars of life had brought their gifts to the newly born; here sparkled health, wealth, fortune, and love; in short, there seemed to be everything for which man could wish on earth.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Pigling stared at the off hind shoe of the grocer's horse which had picked up a stone.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The star of gold paper still stuck in the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The young frogs listened and stared; and as these words did not please them, they made grimaces and dived down under the water.	D,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The guardian angel of the house leaned against the head of the bed; while over the child was spread, as it were, a net of shining stars, and each star was a pearl of happiness.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They stared at each other, and when it became worse the bachelor spoke in Latin, in the hope of being better understood; but it was all useless.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another.	A,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then.	H,H
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The whole of nature was one large holy church, in which the trees and hovering clouds formed the pillars, the flowers and grass the woven velvet carpet, and heaven itself was the great cupola; up there the flame colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared, but millions of stars were lighted; diamond lamps were shining, and the king's son stretched his arms out towards heaven, towards the sea, and towards the wood.	H,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They meant the stars, but they knew no better.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, "Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here," and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.	N,A
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	How that great red thing up there is staring at me!"	Su-,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then the grandfather nodded to a place above the looking-glass, where hung an almanac, with a representation of the Round Tower upon it, and said "Tycho Brahe was another of those who used a sword, but not one to cut into the flesh and bone, but to make the way of the stars of heaven clear, and plain to be understood.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	In the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they stared at their new comrade.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The youngest saw the gilded star, and ran and pulled it off the tree.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The one who stared so just now, and whom he calls the sun, is not my friend; I can feel that too."	F,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, "Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin."	Su-,Su-
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The men stared at him.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Here I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of precious stones.	N,H
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	These were the emperor's good and bad deeds, which stared him in the face now Death sat at his heart.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A white cat was staring at some goldfish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.	F,F
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"My stars!" said she, "what shall I do to keep Frederick from seeing all this slopping about?"	Su-,Su-
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The duck stared at it and exclaimed, "It is very large and not at all like the others.	Su-,Su-
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Ah, I have cured him of staring, though; now he may hang up there, and shine, that I may see myself.	H,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	GRANDMOTHER is very old, her face is wrinkled, and her hair is quite white; but her eyes are like two stars, and they have a mild, gentle expression in them when they look at you, which does you good.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He no longer carried the sharp sword, but a beautiful green branch, full of roses; with this he touched the ceiling, which rose up very high, and where he had touched it there shone a golden star.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Not a single herdsman did we meet, not a solitary hut did we pass; everything appeared lonely and deserted- only a shooting star showed that in the heavens there was yet life.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Ribby stared with amazement-- "Did you ever see the like! so there really WAS a patty-pan?	Su-,Su-
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the king made the most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden, like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a thousand furs was made.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The wedding festivities lasted a whole week, and the dogs sat at the table, and stared with all their eyes.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then he called his daughter and the children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two bright stars in its head.	H,H
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	One morning the wood-cutter went out sorrowfully to his work in the forest, and while he was cutting wood, suddenly there stood before him a tall and beautiful woman with a crown of shining stars on her head, who said to him, "I am the Virgin Mary, mother of the child Jesus.	Sa,Sa
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	They stopped and stood in a row and stared up at the kittens.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The counsellor stared with astonishment as he beheld a most strange procession pass before him.	Su+,Su-
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	He stood a long time musing on the bridge which crosses the Arno, and looking at the glittering stars, reflected in the water which flowed between him and the elegant marble bridge Della Trinita.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But he walked on undaunted, deeper and deeper into the wood, where the most wonderful flowers were growing; there were standing white star lilies with blood-red stamens, sky-blue tulips shining when the wind moved them; apple-trees covered with apples like large glittering soap bubbles: only think how resplendent these trees were in the sunshine!	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Then she felt for the little piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars.	Sa,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The student, for whom my wife washes, says that when we die we shall fly from one star to another.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	"Some one is dying," thought the little girl, for her old grandmother, the only one who had ever loved her, and who was now dead, had told her that when a star falls, a soul was going up to God.	Sa,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Thus she went on and on, and journeyed till she came to the world"s end; then she came to the sun, but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, "I smell flesh and blood this way!" so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a little piece of wood, and said, "If you have not this little piece of wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain, and there your brothers live."	F,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The stars twinkled; and the new moon, in the form of a crescent, was surrounded by the shadowy disc of the whole moon, and looked like a gray globe with a golden rim: it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes.	H,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	I know not whether the clear, blue atmosphere gleamed with its own light, or if the radiance came from the stars; but we could distinguish quite plainly the outline of the mountains.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three dresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared her face and hands with soot.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	A wonderful blaze of light streamed from one of the monuments in the left-side aisle, and a thousand moving stars seemed to form a glory round it; even the coat-of-arms on the tomb-stone shone, and a red ladder on a blue field gleamed like fire.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The woman stared at him and shook her head.	D,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	The night is splendid in the gleam of the Northern Lights, and in the glitter of innumerable twinkling stars.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	She had a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world with him.	N,N
staring	[('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	Where are you going to?"--Pigling Bland stared at him vacantly.	N,N
dull eyes	[('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run out of his mouth.	Sa,N
dull eyes	[('RESIGNATION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')]	But the youngest child in the room, a boy, with large, earnest eyes, mounted upon a chair behind the window curtains, and looked out into the yard, where the moon was pouring a flood of light on the old gravestone,- the stone that had always appeared to him so dull and flat, but which lay there now like a great leaf out of a book of history.
