There they all landed, and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty.

His wings were dry now, so they carried him to a great distance, till at last he reached a hothouse, where a sash of the glass roof was partly open, so he quietly slipped in and buried himself in the warm earth.	('reaching', [('ENVY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')])	
"Now, this jam shall be blessed by God," cried the little tailor, "and give me health and strength"; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it.

At first the thing was merry and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties, till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him the hundred florins.

A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him nothing more to eat, and said, "I want you no longer, so take yourself off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are stronger than a lion."

The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, "I have travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was dancing upon one leg, and singing:	('dancing', [('HAPPINESS', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')])

Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said, "Prince, whither so fast?"

('wanting to hide', [('SURPRISE/SHOCK', 'MENTAL RESPONSES'), ('DREAD', 'MENTAL RESPONSES')])	
In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the ground, as if she was quite dead.	('stretching the arms out wide', [('SATISFACTION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')])	('stretching', [('CONFIDENCE', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')])

He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again.	('putting oneself down', [('REGRET', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')])

Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, "I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling."	('crying', [('SADNESS', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('DEPRESSION', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS'), ('EMBARRASSMENT', 'CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM')])

And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.	('swallowing', [('UNCERTAINTY', 'PHYSICAL SIGNALS')])
